    "Consider a regular hexagon centered at point O1 with side length 5, rotated by π/6 radians. A second, concentric regular hexagon is inscribed within it, scaled by a factor of 1/2, sharing the same center O1. The outer hexagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in counterclockwise order, and the inner hexagon has vertices labeled G, H, I, J, K, L (also counterclockwise), with G lying on segment AB, H on BC, and so on. Point A is a vertex of the outer hexagon, and point F is the adjacent vertex in the clockwise direction. Point B is the adjacent vertex in the counterclockwise direction.\n\nWhat is the measure of angle B-A-F, formed by segments AB and AF at vertex A, expressed in radians as a multiple of π?"

    "We are given a regular hexagon centered at O1, with side length 5, rotated by π/6 radians. There’s a smaller, concentric, scaled-down (by 1/2) regular hexagon inscribed inside it, with vertices lying on the sides of the outer hexagon.\n\nWe are to find the measure of angle **B-A-F**, which is the angle at vertex **A** formed by segments **AB** and **AF**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry of a regular hexagon\n\nIn a **regular hexagon**, each **internal angle** is:\n\n> **Internal angle = (n-2) × π / n = (6-2) × π / 6 = 4π/6 = 2π/3 radians**\n\nBut note: the angle **B-A-F** is **not** the internal angle of the hexagon. Let’s clarify the labeling.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Clarify vertex labeling\n\nWe are told:\n\n- Outer hexagon vertices: **A, B, C, D, E, F** in **counterclockwise** order.\n- Point **A** is a vertex.\n- Point **F** is the **adjacent vertex in the clockwise direction** → so F comes **before** A in counterclockwise order.\n- Point **B** is the **adjacent vertex in the counterclockwise direction** → so B comes **after** A in counterclockwise order.\n\nThus, the order around the hexagon is:\n\n> ... → F → A → B → C → D → E → F → ...\n\nSo, at vertex **A**, the two adjacent vertices are **F** (clockwise neighbor) and **B** (counterclockwise neighbor).\n\nTherefore, angle **B-A-F** is the **internal angle** at vertex A of the regular hexagon.\n\nWait — but the problem says: “angle B-A-F, formed by segments AB and AF at vertex A”.\n\nSegments AB and AF are the two sides meeting at A. So yes, this is the **internal angle** at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Internal angle of a regular hexagon\n\nAs computed above:\n\n> Internal angle = (n-2) × π / n = (6-2) × π / 6 = 4π/6 = **2π/3 radians**\n\nSo, angle B-A-F = **2π/3 radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider the rotation and inner hexagon — are they relevant?\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n- The hexagon is rotated by π/6 radians.\n- There is a smaller concentric hexagon scaled by 1/2, with vertices on the sides of the outer one.\n\nBut the question is **only** about angle B-A-F — which is an angle **at vertex A** of the **outer hexagon**, formed by its two adjacent sides.\n\nRotation of the entire figure does **not** change internal angles — angles are invariant under rotation.\n\nThe inner hexagon is inscribed and scaled, but it does **not** affect the angle at vertex A of the outer hexagon.\n\nTherefore, the rotation and inner hexagon are **red herrings** — they are included to distract or to provide context, but they are **not needed** to compute angle B-A-F.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe angle B-A-F is the internal angle of a regular hexagon, which is:\n\n> **2π/3 radians**\n\n---\n\n✅ **Answer: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}}$**"
