    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle. Points D, E, and F are additional points of tangency or intersection generated during the construction, with E being the midpoint of segment BC.

    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric circles and a triangle circumscribed about the smaller circle, with its vertices on the larger circle. We are to find the radian measure of ∠BAC, expressed as a multiple of π.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup\n\n- **Smaller circle**: Center O1, radius 5.\n- **Larger circle**: Same center O1, radius 10 (obtained by scaling the smaller circle by factor 2).\n- Triangle ABC is **circumscribed about the smaller circle**, meaning the smaller circle is the **incircle** of triangle ABC.\n- Vertices A, B, C lie on the **larger circle** (radius 10), so triangle ABC is **inscribed in the larger circle**.\n- Therefore, triangle ABC is **both inscribed in the larger circle (circumcircle)** and **circumscribed about the smaller circle (incircle)**.\n- This is a very special configuration: a triangle that is **tangential** (has an incircle) and **cyclic** (has a circumcircle). All triangles are cyclic, but not all are tangential — however, **any triangle has an incircle**, so that’s fine. But here, the incircle and circumcircle are **concentric**.\n\nWait — this is **crucial**: the incircle and circumcircle are **concentric**. That is **extremely rare**.\n\nIn general, for a triangle, the incenter and circumcenter are **not** the same point unless the triangle is **equilateral**.\n\n> **Key fact**: The only triangles for which the incenter and circumcenter coincide are **equilateral triangles**.\n\nSo, if the incircle and circumcircle are concentric, then triangle ABC must be **equilateral**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm triangle ABC is equilateral\n\nGiven:\n\n- Incenter = O1 (center of incircle, radius 5)\n- Circumcenter = O1 (center of circumcircle, radius 10)\n- So incenter = circumcenter ⇒ triangle is equilateral.\n\n✅ Therefore, triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find ∠BAC\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, **all interior angles are equal to 60°**, or in radians:\n\n> 60° = π/3 radians.\n\nSo ∠BAC = π/3.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Address the extra points D, E, F\n\nThe problem mentions points D, E, F, and says E is the midpoint of BC, and EF is drawn. But since we’ve already deduced the triangle is equilateral, and the angle at A is π/3, these extra points are likely **red herrings** or meant to distract — or perhaps to confirm the equilateral nature.\n\nLet’s briefly check:\n\n- In an equilateral triangle, the incenter, circumcenter, centroid, orthocenter, etc., all coincide.\n- The point E, being the midpoint of BC, lies on the median from A, which also passes through O1.\n- The incircle touches BC at its midpoint in an equilateral triangle — so point E is also the point of tangency of the incircle with side BC.\n- Similarly, points D and F are likely the points of tangency on AB and AC.\n- Segment EF connects the point of tangency on BC to the point of tangency on AC — but this doesn’t affect ∠BAC.\n\nSo, even though these points are mentioned, they do not change the angle at A.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe radian measure of ∠BAC is **π/3**.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Answer**: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}}$"
