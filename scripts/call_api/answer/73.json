    "We are given a circle centered at O₁ with radius 5, and an inscribed triangle ABC. A perpendicular is drawn from point C to chord AB, meeting AB at foot F₀. We are to find the measure of angle ∠BAC in radians, expressed in terms of π, using **vector geometry**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the diagram and constraints\n\n- Circle centered at O₁, radius = 5.\n- Triangle ABC is inscribed → all vertices lie on the circle.\n- CF₀ ⊥ AB, with F₀ on AB → F₀ is the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB.\n- We are to find ∠BAC, the angle at vertex A between vectors AB and AC.\n\nBut — **there is no coordinate system given**, and **no specific positions** for A, B, C. So we must deduce if there’s a special property or symmetry.\n\nWait — the diagram is drawn with specific placements. Let’s analyze it visually (even though it’s described):\n\n- Points A, B, C are on the circle.\n- Segment AB is a chord.\n- CF₀ is perpendicular to AB → so CF₀ is the altitude from C to AB.\n- O₁ is the center, and lies on CF₀? Looking at the diagram description: “F₀” is labeled on AB, and “O₁” is on the segment from C to F₀? That would imply that the center O₁ lies on the perpendicular from C to AB.\n\nThat’s a **critical observation**.\n\nIf the center O₁ lies on the perpendicular from C to AB, then that perpendicular passes through the center → which implies that **AB is a chord, and the perpendicular from C to AB passes through the center**.\n\nBut in a circle, the perpendicular from the center to a chord bisects the chord. So if O₁ lies on CF₀, and CF₀ ⊥ AB, then O₁ lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB.\n\nBut C is also on that line — so the line CF₀ is the perpendicular bisector of AB, and passes through C and O₁.\n\nThat implies that **C lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB** → which in a circle means that **arc AC = arc BC**, so triangle ABC is **isosceles with AC = BC**.\n\nWait — more precisely: if C lies on the perpendicular bisector of chord AB, then C is equidistant from A and B → so AC = BC → triangle ABC is isosceles with apex C.\n\nBut we are to find ∠BAC — angle at A.\n\nStill, without more info, we cannot compute a numerical value — unless there is more structure.\n\nWait — perhaps the diagram is symmetric in a way that suggests ABC is a **right triangle**?\n\nLook again: in the diagram, point C is at the bottom, A and B are on the right and top-left, and O₁ is inside, on CF₀.\n\nBut here’s a key idea: **if O₁ lies on CF₀, and CF₀ ⊥ AB, then O₁ lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB** → so O₁ is equidistant from A and B → which is always true since it’s the center.\n\nBut more importantly: if CF₀ passes through O₁, and C is on the circle, then the line CO₁ is perpendicular to AB.\n\nSo the radius from O₁ to C is perpendicular to chord AB.\n\nBut in circle geometry, **if a radius is perpendicular to a chord, it bisects the chord**. So CF₀ bisects AB, and since it passes through O₁, then O₁ lies on the perpendicular bisector — which is always true.\n\nBut here’s the crucial point: **the line from the center O₁ to point C is perpendicular to AB**.\n\nThat is, **vector O₁C is perpendicular to vector AB**.\n\nThat’s a strong condition.\n\nLet’s use vector geometry as requested.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Set up a coordinate system\n\nTo make this concrete, let’s place the circle and points in a coordinate system.\n\nLet’s place the center O₁ at the origin: **O₁ = (0, 0)**.\n\nSince the radius is 5, any point on the circle satisfies |P| = 5.\n\nLet’s assume, without loss of generality, that point C lies on the negative y-axis, because in the diagram, C is at the bottom, and CF₀ goes upward through O₁.\n\nSo let’s set:\n\n> **C = (0, -5)**\n\nSince CF₀ is perpendicular to AB and passes through O₁, and O₁ is (0,0), then the line CF₀ is the y-axis (x=0).\n\nTherefore, AB is horizontal (since perpendicular to vertical line), so AB is parallel to the x-axis.\n\nSo chord AB is horizontal, and its perpendicular bisector is the y-axis → so A and B are symmetric with respect to the y-axis.\n\nLet’s let:\n\n> **A = (x, y)**  \n> **B = (-x, y)**\n\nSince AB is horizontal, same y-coordinate.\n\nAlso, since A and B lie on the circle centered at (0,0) with radius 5:\n\n> x² + y² = 25\n\nSo A = (x, y), B = (-x, y), C = (0, -5)\n\nNow, we are to find angle ∠BAC — the angle at A between vectors AB and AC.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Use vector geometry to find angle ∠BAC\n\nAngle at A between vectors AB and AC.\n\nRecall: the angle θ between two vectors **u** and **v** is given by:\n\n> cosθ = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)\n\nSo we need vectors **AB** and **AC**.\n\nFirst, compute vectors:\n\n- Vector AB = B - A = (-x - x, y - y) = (-2x, 0)\n- Vector AC = C - A = (0 - x, -5 - y) = (-x, -5 - y)\n\nNow, compute the dot product AB · AC:\n\n> AB · AC = (-2x)(-x) + (0)(-5 - y) = 2x² + 0 = 2x²\n\nCompute |AB|:\n\n> |AB| = sqrt((-2x)² + 0²) = sqrt(4x²) = 2|x|\n\nCompute |AC|:\n\n> |AC| = sqrt((-x)² + (-5 - y)²) = sqrt(x² + (5 + y)²)\n\nSo:\n\n> cos(∠BAC) = (2x²) / [2|x| * sqrt(x² + (5 + y)²)] = (x²) / [|x| * sqrt(x² + (5 + y)²)]\n\nSince x² = |x|², we can write:\n\n> cos(∠BAC) = |x| / sqrt(x² + (5 + y)²)\n\nBut we also know from the circle: x² + y² = 25 → x² = 25 - y²\n\nSubstitute:\n\n> cos(∠BAC) = sqrt(25 - y²) / sqrt( (25 - y²) + (5 + y)² )\n\nSimplify denominator:\n\n(25 - y²) + (5 + y)² = 25 - y² + 25 + 10y + y² = 50 + 10y\n\nSo:\n\n> cos(∠BAC) = sqrt(25 - y²) / sqrt(50 + 10y)\n\nWe can factor denominator:\n\nsqrt(50 + 10y) = sqrt(10(5 + y)) = sqrt(10) * sqrt(5 + y)\n\nNumerator: sqrt(25 - y²) = sqrt((5 - y)(5 + y))\n\nSo:\n\n> cos(∠BAC) = sqrt((5 - y)(5 + y)) / [sqrt(10) * sqrt(5 + y)] = sqrt(5 - y) / sqrt(10)\n\nProvided that 5 + y > 0 (which it is, since y ≥ -5, and if y = -5, then x=0, degenerate triangle).\n\nSo:\n\n> cos(∠BAC) = sqrt( (5 - y)/10 )\n\nThis still depends on y. But we need a **numerical value** — so perhaps there’s more constraint.\n\nWait — in the diagram, point F₀ is the foot of perpendicular from C to AB. Since AB is horizontal at height y, and C is at (0, -5), then the foot F₀ is the point on AB directly above C — which is (0, y), because AB is the line y = constant.\n\nSo F₀ = (0, y)\n\nBut in the diagram, O₁ is also on CF₀ — which is the line from C(0,-5) to F₀(0,y), which is the y-axis — and O₁ is (0,0), which lies on that line — so that checks out.\n\nBut now, is there any other condition? The problem doesn’t specify more, but perhaps we are to assume that triangle ABC is such that O₁ is the midpoint of CF₀? Or something else?\n\nWait — perhaps the diagram implies that F₀ is the midpoint of AB? But we already have that, since AB is symmetric about y-axis, and F₀ is (0,y), which is the midpoint of A(x,y) and B(-x,y).\n\nSo that’s consistent.\n\nBut still, we have one free parameter: y.\n\nUnless... perhaps the triangle is equilateral? Or right-angled?\n\nWait — let’s check if angle at C is right angle.\n\nVector CA = A - C = (x, y + 5)\n\nVector CB = B - C = (-x, y + 5)\n\nDot product CA · CB = (x)(-x) + (y+5)(y+5) = -x² + (y+5)²\n\nSet to zero for right angle at C:\n\n> -x² + (y+5)² = 0 → (y+5)² = x²\n\nBut x² = 25 - y², so:\n\n> (y+5)² = 25 - y²  \n> y² + 10y + 25 = 25 - y²  \n> y² + 10y + 25 - 25 + y² = 0  \n> 2y² + 10y = 0  \n> 2y(y + 5) = 0  \n> y = 0 or y = -5\n\ny = -5 → C and A,B coincide? No, if y=-5, x=0, so A=B=C=(0,-5), degenerate.\n\ny=0 → then x² = 25, so x = ±5\n\nSo A = (5,0), B = (-5,0), C = (0,-5)\n\nThis is a valid triangle!\n\nAnd angle at C: CA = (5,5), CB = (-5,5), dot product = -25 + 25 = 0 → right angle at C.\n\nSo triangle ABC is right-angled at C, with hypotenuse AB.\n\nAnd since it’s inscribed in a circle, and angle at C is 90°, then AB must be the diameter — which it is: from (-5,0) to (5,0), length 10, diameter of circle radius 5 — perfect.\n\nSo this must be the intended configuration.\n\nIn fact, this is the **only** non-degenerate case where the center lies on the altitude from C to AB, and the triangle is inscribed — because if angle at C is 90°, then AB is diameter, and the center is midpoint of AB, which lies on the perpendicular from C to AB (since in a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse has properties, but here, since AB is horizontal, and C is at (0,-5), the perpendicular from C to AB is vertical, passing through (0,0) — the center — which is midpoint of AB.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo we take:\n\n> A = (5, 0)  \n> B = (-5, 0)  \n> C = (0, -5)\n\nNow, find angle ∠BAC — angle at A between vectors AB and AC.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Compute vectors and angle\n\nPoints:\n\n- A = (5, 0)\n- B = (-5, 0)\n- C = (0, -5)\n\nVector AB = B - A = (-5 - 5, 0 - 0) = (-10, 0)\n\nVector AC = C - A = (0 - 5, -5 - 0) = (-5, -5)\n\nNow, angle θ between AB and AC:\n\ncosθ = (AB · AC) / (|AB| |AC|)\n\nCompute dot product:\n\nAB · AC = (-10)(-5) + (0)(-5) = 50 + 0 = 50\n\n|AB| = sqrt((-10)^2 + 0^2) = 10\n\n|AC| = sqrt((-5)^2 + (-5)^2) = sqrt(25 + 25) = sqrt(50) = 5√2\n\nSo:\n\ncosθ = 50 / (10 * 5√2) = 50 / (50√2) = 1/√2\n\nTherefore:\n\nθ = arccos(1/√2) = π/4 radians\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{4}}"
