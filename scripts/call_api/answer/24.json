    "We are given a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3. A square is inscribed such that:\n\n- One of its vertices is at O1 (the center of the octagon),\n- Its center is at point E,\n- Point E lies on a side of the octagon,\n- The square is oriented so that its sides are aligned with the diagonals of the octagon (i.e., rotated 45° relative to the coordinate axes if the octagon is axis-aligned),\n- We are to find the length of segment O1E.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nA regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal angles. The center O1 is equidistant from all vertices. The square is inscribed such that:\n\n- One vertex is at O1.\n- The square is rotated 45° relative to the octagon’s sides (since its sides are aligned with the diagonals of the octagon).\n- The center of the square is E, which lies on a side of the octagon.\n\nThis implies that the square extends from O1 outward, and its center E is located halfway along the diagonal from O1 to the opposite vertex of the square.\n\nLet’s denote the square as having vertices: O1, P, Q, R, with O1 being one vertex, and E being the center of the square.\n\nIn a square, the center is the midpoint of the diagonals. So if O1 is one vertex, then the opposite vertex (say, Q) must be such that E is the midpoint of O1Q.\n\nThus, vectorially:  \n**E = (O1 + Q)/2**  \n⇒ **Q = 2E - O1**\n\nBut since O1 is the origin (we can set coordinates to simplify), let’s place O1 at the origin: **O1 = (0, 0)**.\n\nThen E is at some point (x, y), and Q = (2x, 2y).\n\nThe square has sides aligned with the diagonals of the octagon. In a regular octagon, the diagonals are at 45°, 135°, etc., so the square’s sides are horizontal/vertical if the octagon is rotated 45°, or vice versa. But since the square’s sides are aligned with the octagon’s diagonals, and the octagon is regular, we can assume without loss of generality that the square is axis-aligned if we rotate the coordinate system appropriately — but perhaps it’s easier to work with standard position.\n\nActually, let’s think differently.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use symmetry and known properties of regular octagons\n\nIn a regular octagon with side length s, the distance from the center to a vertex (the radius R) is:\n\n> **R = s / (2 sin(π/8))**\n\nBut we might not need that directly.\n\nAlternatively, we can place the octagon on the coordinate plane with center at origin, and compute coordinates of its vertices.\n\nLet’s do that.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Place the regular octagon on coordinate plane\n\nAssume the regular octagon is centered at O1 = (0, 0), and one of its vertices lies along the positive x-axis. The vertices are at angles 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°.\n\nThe distance from center to vertex (circumradius R) for a regular octagon with side length s is:\n\n> **R = s / (2 sin(π/8))**\n\nWe are given s = 3.\n\nCompute sin(π/8):\n\nπ/8 = 22.5°\n\nWe know:\n\n> sin(22.5°) = sin(45°/2) = √[(1 - cos(45°))/2] = √[(1 - √2/2)/2] = √[(2 - √2)/4] = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo,\n\n> R = 3 / (2 * √(2 - √2)/2) = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nWe can rationalize or simplify later if needed.\n\nBut perhaps we don’t need R directly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Understand the square’s position\n\nThe square has:\n\n- One vertex at O1 = (0,0)\n- Center at E, which lies on a side of the octagon\n- Sides aligned with the diagonals of the octagon → meaning the square is rotated 45° relative to the octagon’s sides.\n\nWait — if the square’s sides are aligned with the diagonals of the octagon, and the octagon’s diagonals are at 45°, 135°, etc., then the square’s sides are horizontal/vertical if we rotate the octagon 45°, but let’s think carefully.\n\nActually, in a regular octagon, the diagonals (connecting every second vertex) are longer and are at 45° to the sides.\n\nBut the key is: the square is oriented so that its sides are aligned with the diagonals of the octagon. So if we imagine the octagon with horizontal and vertical sides (like a stop sign), then its diagonals are at 45°, so the square’s sides would be at 45° — meaning the square is diamond-shaped relative to the octagon.\n\nBut the problem says: “its sides are aligned with the diagonals of the octagon” — so if the octagon’s diagonals are at 45°, then the square’s sides are also at 45° — meaning the square is rotated 45° relative to the coordinate axes.\n\nBut then, if one vertex is at O1, and the square is rotated 45°, then its sides are along the lines y = x and y = -x.\n\nWait — that might be the key.\n\nAssume the square has sides parallel to the lines y = x and y = -x. Then its diagonals are along the x- and y-axes.\n\nBut the problem says: “its sides are aligned with the diagonals of the octagon”. So if the octagon’s diagonals are along y = x and y = -x, then the square’s sides are along those directions — meaning the square is axis-aligned in a 45° rotated system.\n\nActually, to avoid confusion, let’s define:\n\nLet’s assume the regular octagon is oriented with sides horizontal and vertical — i.e., a “stop sign” orientation. Then its diagonals (connecting every second vertex) are at 45°, so the square’s sides are along those 45° directions.\n\nTherefore, the square is rotated 45° relative to the coordinate axes.\n\nSo, if we place O1 at (0,0), and the square has one vertex at O1, and is rotated 45°, then the square extends along the directions of the diagonals.\n\nIn such a square, if one vertex is at (0,0), and it’s rotated 45°, then the adjacent vertices would be at (a, a) and (a, -a) or something like that? Wait, no.\n\nLet’s think of a square with sides aligned with y = x and y = -x.\n\nActually, if a square has sides parallel to y = x and y = -x, then its sides are at 45° and 135°, so the square is diamond-shaped relative to the axes.\n\nIn that case, if one vertex is at (0,0), then the next vertex along the side in direction of y = x would be at (d, d) for some d, but then the side length would be the distance from (0,0) to (d,d) = d√2.\n\nBut we don’t know the side length of the square — it’s not given. However, we know that the center E lies on a side of the octagon.\n\nSo perhaps we can parameterize the square.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Parameterize the square\n\nLet the square have side length s_sq (unknown for now).\n\nSince it’s rotated 45°, and one vertex is at O1 = (0,0), and its sides are aligned with y = x and y = -x, then the square extends in the directions of the vectors (1,1) and (1,-1).\n\nActually, to make it easier, let’s define the square with vertices:\n\nLet’s say the square has vertices at:\n\n- O1 = (0,0)\n- P = (a, a)\n- Q = (0, 2a)\n- R = (-a, a)\n\nWait, let’s check distances.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (a,a): distance = a√2\n\nFrom (a,a) to (0,2a): distance = √[(a-0)^2 + (a-2a)^2] = √[a² + a²] = a√2\n\nFrom (0,2a) to (-a,a): √[a² + a²] = a√2\n\nFrom (-a,a) to (0,0): √[a² + a²] = a√2\n\nAnd angles: the vectors from (0,0) to (a,a) and to (-a,a) are (a,a) and (-a,a), dot product = -a² + a² = 0, so 90° — good.\n\nSo this is a square with side length a√2, centered at the average of vertices: ((0 + a + 0 - a)/4, (0 + a + 2a + a)/4) = (0, 4a/4) = (0, a)\n\nSo center E is at (0, a)\n\nBut in this configuration, the square is oriented with sides along y = x and y = -x? Let's see the sides:\n\nFrom (0,0) to (a,a): direction vector (1,1) — along y=x\n\nFrom (a,a) to (0,2a): direction vector (-1,1) — along y = -x + c? Slope = (2a - a)/(0 - a) = a/(-a) = -1 — so along y = -x + b\n\nYes, so sides are along directions of 45° and 135°, i.e., aligned with the diagonals of the octagon (if octagon is axis-aligned).\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo in this square, center E is at (0, a), and O1 is at (0,0), so O1E = distance = |a - 0| = a (since same x-coordinate).\n\nBut we also know that point E lies on a side of the octagon.\n\nSo we need to find a such that E = (0, a) lies on a side of the regular octagon centered at (0,0) with side length 3.\n\nNow, we need to find the equation of the side of the octagon that contains point (0, a).\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Find coordinates of octagon vertices\n\nAssume the regular octagon is centered at (0,0), with one vertex at (R, 0), where R is the circumradius.\n\nAs before, R = s / (2 sin(π/8)) = 3 / (2 sin(22.5°))\n\nCompute sin(22.5°) = √[(1 - cos(45°))/2] = √[(1 - √2/2)/2] = √[(2 - √2)/4] = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo R = 3 / [2 * √(2 - √2)/2] = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nRationalize denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √(2 + √2):\n\nR = 3 √(2 + √2) / √[(2 - √2)(2 + √2)] = 3 √(2 + √2) / √(4 - 2) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √2\n\n= (3 / √2) * √(2 + √2) = 3 √[(2 + √2)/2]\n\nBut perhaps we can leave it as R = 3 / √(2 - √2) for now.\n\nThe vertices of the octagon are at angles 0°, 45°, 90°, ..., 315°.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nV0: (R, 0)\n\nV1: (R cos45°, R sin45°) = (R/√2, R/√2)\n\nV2: (0, R)\n\nV3: (-R/√2, R/√2)\n\nV4: (-R, 0)\n\nV5: (-R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nV6: (0, -R)\n\nV7: (R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nNow, the sides are between consecutive vertices.\n\nPoint E is at (0, a), and it lies on a side of the octagon.\n\nLooking at the vertices, the side from V1 to V2 is from (R/√2, R/√2) to (0, R)\n\nSimilarly, side from V2 to V3 is from (0,R) to (-R/√2, R/√2)\n\nSince E is at (0,a), and assuming a > 0, it must lie on the side from V1 to V2 or from V2 to V3.\n\nBut (0,a) has x=0, so it can only lie on the side from V2 to V3 if a = R, but V2 is (0,R), and V3 is (-R/√2, R/√2), so the line from (0,R) to (-R/√2, R/√2) has x from 0 to -R/√2, y from R to R/√2.\n\nAt x=0, y=R, which is vertex V2.\n\nBut E is the center of the square, and if it were at V2, then the square would have vertices at (0,0), (a,a), (0,2a), (-a,a), and if E=(0,a) is at (0,R), then a=R, but then the square would extend to (0,2R), which is outside the octagon, and also, the side of the octagon at V2 is a vertex, not a side — the problem says E lies on a side, not a vertex.\n\nSo probably E lies on the side from V1 to V2.\n\nLet’s find the equation of the line from V1 = (R/√2, R/√2) to V2 = (0, R)\n\nParametrize this line.\n\nLet t from 0 to 1, point = V1 + t*(V2 - V1) = (R/√2, R/√2) + t*(-R/√2, R - R/√2)\n\nCompute R - R/√2 = R(1 - 1/√2)\n\nSo point = (R/√2 - t R/√2, R/√2 + t R(1 - 1/√2))\n\nSet x-coordinate to 0 to find where it crosses x=0.\n\nx = R/√2 (1 - t) = 0 ⇒ 1 - t = 0 ⇒ t = 1\n\nThen y = R/√2 + 1 * R(1 - 1/√2) = R/√2 + R - R/√2 = R\n\nSo at t=1, we get (0,R), which is V2 again.\n\nThat means the side from V1 to V2 does not have any point with x=0 except at V2.\n\nSimilarly, side from V2 to V3: from (0,R) to (-R/√2, R/√2)\n\nParametrize: (0,R) + s*(-R/√2, R/√2 - R) = (0 - s R/√2, R + s R(1/√2 - 1))\n\nSet x=0: -s R/√2 = 0 ⇒ s=0, then y=R, again V2.\n\nSo no other point on the sides has x=0 except V2.\n\nBut E is at (0,a), and if it's on a side, it must be on a side that is not vertical.\n\nPerhaps I made a mistake in assuming the square is oriented with E on the y-axis.\n\nIn my parameterization, I assumed the square has vertices at (0,0), (a,a), (0,2a), (-a,a), so center at (0,a), but this assumes the square is symmetric about the y-axis.\n\nBut in the octagon, the sides are not symmetric about the y-axis in a way that allows a point on the side to have x=0 except at vertices.\n\nPerhaps the square is not aligned with the y-axis.\n\nLet's rethink.\n\nThe square has one vertex at O1 = (0,0), and its sides are aligned with the diagonals of the octagon. The diagonals of the octagon are in directions 45°, 135°, etc.\n\nSo the square's sides are along those directions, so the square is rotated 45°.\n\nIn such a square, if one vertex is at (0,0), then the adjacent vertices are at (s, s) and (s, -s) or something, but let's define it properly.\n\nLet the square have side length s_sq.\n\nSince it's rotated 45°, the vectors along the sides are (1,1) and (1,-1) scaled.\n\nThe direction vectors for the sides are unit vectors in directions 45° and 135°, which are (cos45°, sin45°) = (1/√2, 1/√2) and (cos135°, sin135°) = (-1/√2, 1/√2)\n\nBut for a square, from a vertex, you go along one side vector, then turn 90°.\n\nIf we go from O1 = (0,0) along vector v1 = (a, a) (direction 45°), then the next side should be perpendicular, so rotate v1 by 90°.\n\nRotating (a,a) by 90° counterclockwise gives (-a, a)\n\nSo from (0,0) to (a,a), then to (a,a) + (-a,a) = (0,2a), then to (0,2a) + (-a,-a) = (-a,a), then back to (0,0) + (a,-a) wait no.\n\nFrom (0,0) to (a,a) — vector v1 = (a,a)\n\nThen from (a,a) to (a,a) + rotate v1 by 90° = (a,a) + (-a,a) = (0,2a)\n\nThen from (0,2a) to (0,2a) + rotate again by 90° = (0,2a) + (-a,-a) = (-a,a)\n\nThen from (-a,a) to (-a,a) + rotate again = (-a,a) + (a,-a) = (0,0) — good.\n\nSo vertices: (0,0), (a,a), (0,2a), (-a,a)\n\nCenter E is the average of vertices: ((0 + a + 0 - a)/4, (0 + a + 2a + a)/4) = (0, 4a/4) = (0, a)\n\nSame as before.\n\nBut as we saw, (0,a) is on the y-axis, and in the octagon, the only point on the y-axis on the boundary is (0,R) and (0,-R), which are vertices, not on sides.\n\nSo this suggests that my assumption about the orientation is wrong, or the square is not symmetric about the y-axis.\n\nPerhaps the square is not aligned with the y-axis; perhaps it is rotated, but still has sides aligned with the octagon's diagonals.\n\nThe octagon's diagonals are in directions 45°, 135°, 225°, 315°, so the square's sides are along those, so the square's sides are at 45° to the axes.\n\nBut in that case, if one vertex is at (0,0), the square could be in any of the four quadrants.\n\nPerhaps E is not on the y-axis, but on a side that is not vertical.\n\nLet's assume that the square is oriented with sides along 45° and 135°, and one vertex at (0,0), and the center E is at some point (x,y) on a side of the octagon.\n\nIn a square with sides along 45° and 135°, the center is at the midpoint of the diagonal.\n\nIf one vertex is at (0,0), and the opposite vertex is at (2x,2y), then E = (x,y), and the side length can be found.\n\nThe vector from (0,0) to (2x,2y) is the diagonal of the square, so length of diagonal is 2√(x² + y²), so side length s = diagonal / √2 = 2√(x² + y²) / √2 = √2 * √(x² + y²) = √(2(x² + y²))\n\nBut we don't know s.\n\nThe key is that E = (x,y) lies on a side of the octagon.\n\nSo we need to find a point (x,y) on a side of the octagon such that the square with vertex at (0,0) and center at (x,y) has sides aligned with the diagonals of the octagon.\n\nFor the square to have sides aligned with the diagonals of the octagon, the vector from O1 to E should be along the direction of the diagonal of the square.\n\nIn a square, the center is at the intersection of the diagonals, and the diagonals are perpendicular and equal.\n\nIf one vertex is at (0,0), and the center is at (x,y), then the opposite vertex is at (2x,2y), and the other two vertices are at (x+y, y-x) and (x-y, x+y) or something like that.\n\nLet's think.\n\nIn a square, if one vertex is at A, and center at O, then the other vertices are obtained by rotating A around O by 90°, 180°, 270°.\n\nSo if A = (0,0), O = (x,y), then the other vertices are:\n\nB = rotate A around O by 90° = O + i*(A - O) in complex numbers.\n\nIn vectors, to rotate a point P around O by 90° counterclockwise: (O_x - (P_y - O_y), O_y + (P_x - O_x)) = (O_x - P_y + O_y, O_y + P_x - O_x)\n\nStandard formula: to rotate point P around O by 90° CCW: (O_x - (P_y - O_y), O_y + (P_x - O_x)) = (O_x - P_y + O_y, O_y + P_x - O_x)\n\nLet P = A = (0,0), O = (x,y)\n\nThen B = (x - (0 - y), y + (0 - x)) = (x + y, y - x)\n\nThen C = rotate B around O by 90° = (x - (B_y - y), y + (B_x - x)) = (x - ((y - x) - y), y + ((x + y) - x)) = (x - (-x), y + y) = (x + x, 2y) = (2x, 2y)\n\nThen D = rotate C around O by 90° = (x - (2y - y), y + (2x - x)) = (x - y, y + x)\n\nThen back to A.\n\nSo vertices: A(0,0), B(x+y, y-x), C(2x,2y), D(x-y, x+y)\n\nFor the sides to be aligned with the diagonals of the octagon, the sides should be in directions 45°, 135°, etc.\n\nThe side from A to B: from (0,0) to (x+y, y-x)\n\nVector: (x+y, y-x)\n\nThe direction should be at 45° or 135°, etc., so the slope should be 1 or -1.\n\nSlope = (y-x)/(x+y)\n\nSet this equal to 1 or -1.\n\nCase 1: (y-x)/(x+y) = 1 ⇒ y - x = x + y ⇒ -x = x ⇒ 2x = 0 ⇒ x=0\n\nThen slope = (y-0)/(0+y) = y/y = 1, good.\n\nThen E = (0,y), which is what we had earlier.\n\nCase 2: (y-x)/(x+y) = -1 ⇒ y - x = - (x + y) ⇒ y - x = -x - y ⇒ y = -y ⇒ 2y = 0 ⇒ y=0\n\nThen E = (x,0), on x-axis.\n\nBy symmetry, we can assume x=0 or y=0, but as before, on the axes, the only points on the octagon boundary are vertices.\n\nSo perhaps the square is not with sides exactly at 45°, but the problem says \"aligned with the diagonals\", which are at 45°, so it should be.\n\nPerhaps \"aligned with the diagonals\" means that the sides are parallel to the diagonals, which are at 45°, so yes.\n\nBut then E must be on a side, not on a vertex.\n\nSo perhaps in the octagon, there are sides that are not on the axes, and E is on one of them.\n\nFor example, the side from V0 = (R,0) to V1 = (R/√2, R/√2)\n\nThis side is from (R,0) to (R/√2, R/√2)\n\nParametrize this side.\n\nLet t from 0 to 1, point = (R,0) + t*(R/√2 - R, R/√2 - 0) = (R + t R(1/√2 - 1), 0 + t R/√2) = R(1 + t(1/√2 - 1), t/√2)\n\nSo x = R [1 + t(1/√2 - 1)] , y = R t /√2\n\nNow, for the square with vertex at (0,0) and center at (x,y), and sides aligned with 45°, we have that the vector from (0,0) to (x,y) should be along the diagonal of the square, and for the sides to be at 45°, the vector (x,y) should be at 45° or 135°, etc., so x = y or x = -y, etc.\n\nIn this case, for the point on this side, x and y are both positive, so perhaps x = y.\n\nSet x = y:\n\nR [1 + t(1/√2 - 1)] = R t /√2\n\nDivide both sides by R (assume R≠0):\n\n1 + t(1/√2 - 1) = t /√2\n\nBring all to one side:\n\n1 + t/√2 - t - t/√2 = 0\n\nSimplify: 1 - t = 0 ⇒ t = 1\n\nThen x = R [1 + 1*(1/√2 - 1)] = R/√2, y = R*1/√2 = R/√2, so (x,y) = (R/√2, R/√2) = V1, a vertex.\n\nAgain, not on a side.\n\nSimilarly, for other sides.\n\nPerhaps for the side from V1 to V2: from (R/√2, R/√2) to (0, R)\n\nParametrize: (R/√2, R/√2) + s*(0 - R/√2, R - R/√2) = (R/√2 - s R/√2, R/√2 + s R(1 - 1/√2)) \n\nSet x = y:\n\nR/√2 (1 - s) = R/√2 + s R(1 - 1/√2)\n\nDivide by R/√2:\n\n1 - s = 1 + s √2 (1 - 1/√2) / 1  wait, let's careful.\n\nLeft side: x = R/√2 (1 - s)\n\nRight side: y = R/√2 + s R(1 - 1/√2) = R [ 1/√2 + s(1 - 1/√2) ]\n\nSet x = y:\n\n R/√2 (1 - s) = R [ 1/√2 + s(1 - 1/√2) ]\n\nDivide both sides by R:\n\n (1/√2) (1 - s) = 1/√2 + s(1 - 1/√2)\n\nSubtract 1/√2 from both sides:\n\n (1/√2) (1 - s) - 1/√2 = s(1 - 1/√2)\n\n (1/√2) (- s) = s(1 - 1/√2)\n\n -s/√2 = s(1 - 1/√2)\n\nAssume s ≠ 0, divide both sides by s:\n\n -1/√2 = 1 - 1/√2\n\nThen -1/√2 = 1 - 1/√2 ⇒ 0 = 1, contradiction.\n\nSo no solution with x=y on this side.\n\nPerhaps for the square, the vector from O1 to E is not along 45°, but the sides are along 45°, which is different.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nPerhaps \"sides are aligned with the diagonals\" means that the sides of the square are parallel to the diagonals of the octagon, which are at 45°, so the square's sides are at 45°, so the square is rotated 45°.\n\nIn that case, for a square with sides at 45°, the center E is at (x,y), and the vertex at (0,0), then the vector from (0,0) to (x,y) should be along the diagonal of the square, which is at 0° or 90° if the square is rotated 45°, but if the square is rotated 45°, its diagonals are along the axes.\n\nYes! That's it.\n\nIf the square has sides aligned with the diagonals of the octagon, and the octagon's diagonals are at 45°, then the square's sides are at 45°, so its diagonals are at 0° and 90°, i.e., along the x- and y-axes.\n\nSo the diagonals of the square are horizontal and vertical.\n\nTherefore, if one vertex is at (0,0), and the diagonals are along the axes, then the opposite vertex is at (2a, 2b) for some a,b, but since diagonals are along axes, the other two vertices are at (2a,0) and (0,2b) or something.\n\nLet's define.\n\nIf the square has diagonals along the x- and y-axes, then the vertices are at (c,0), (0,d), (-c,0), (0,-d) for some c,d, but for a square, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular, so |c| = |d|, and the vertices are at (c,0), (0,c), (-c,0), (0,-c) — but then it's a diamond, and the sides are at 45°, good.\n\nBut in this case, the vertices are at (c,0), (0,c), (-c,0), (0,-c), so if one vertex is at (0,0), it's not on this square.\n\nUnless we shift.\n\nSuppose the square has vertices at (a,b), (a,-b), (-a,b), (-a,-b) — then diagonals are along x and y axes, but then it's not a square unless a=b.\n\nIf a=b, then vertices at (a,a), (a,-a), (-a,a), (-a,-a) — then the sides are from (a,a) to (a,-a) — vertical, not at 45°.\n\nI think I have a confusion.\n\nLet me clarify:\n\n- If a square has sides parallel to the x and y axes, then its diagonals are at 45°.\n- If a square has sides at 45° to the axes, then its diagonals are parallel to the axes.\n\nYes.\n\nSo in this problem, \"sides are aligned with the diagonals of the octagon\" — the octagon's diagonals are at 45° to its sides, so if the octagon has sides horizontal/vertical, its diagonals are at 45°, so the square's sides are at 45°, so the square's diagonals are horizontal and vertical.\n\nTherefore, for the square, its diagonals are along the x- and y-axes.\n\nSo if one vertex is at (0,0), and the diagonals are along the axes, then the square must have its diagonals passing through (0,0), so the other end of the diagonal is at (2a, 0) or (0,2b), but for a square, the diagonals are equal and perpendicular, so if one diagonal is from (0,0) to (2a,0), then the other diagonal must be from (a, b) to (a, -b) or something.\n\nStandard square with diagonals along axes: vertices at (c,0), (0,c), (-c,0), (0,-c) — but then the center is at (0,0), and vertices are at those points.\n\nBut in this case, if one vertex is at (0,0), it can't be, unless we have a different configuration.\n\nPerhaps the square has one vertex at (0,0), and the diagonal from (0,0) to (2a,2b) is along the direction of the diagonal of the square, but for the diagonals to be along the axes, the vector (2a,2b) should be along x or y axis, so b=0 or a=0.\n\nSo again, on the axes.\n\nThis is frustrating.\n\nPerhaps \"aligned with the diagonals\" means that the sides are parallel to the lines connecting opposite vertices, which for a regular octagon are at 0°, 45°, 90°, etc., so the square's sides are parallel to those, so at 0°, 45°, etc.\n\nBut then for the square to have sides at 45°, and one vertex at (0,0), and center at E on a side of the octagon, we can assume that E is at (x,y) with x=y, by symmetry, and on a side.\n\nEarlier we saw that on the side from V0 to V1, when x=y, we get t=1, point V1.\n\nBut perhaps for the side from V7 to V0: from (R/√2, -R/√2) to (R,0)\n\nParametrize: (R/√2, -R/√2) + u*(R - R/√2, 0 + R/√2) = (R/√2 + u R(1 - 1/√2), -R/√2 + u R/√2)\n\nSet x = y:\n\n R/√2 + u R(1 - 1/√2) = -R/√2 + u R/√2\n\nDivide by R:\n\n 1/√2 + u(1 - 1/√2) = -1/√2 + u/√2\n\nBring all to left:\n\n 1/√2 + u - u/√2 +1/√2 - u/√2 = 0\n\n2/√2 + u - 2u/√2 = 0\n\n√2 + u(1 - 2/√2) = 0\n\n1 - 2/√2 = 1 - √2\n\nSo √2 + u(1 - √2) = 0\n\nu(1 - √2) = -√2\n\nu = (-√2) / (1 - √2) = √2 / (√2 - 1) = √2 (√2 + 1) / ((√2 - 1)(√2 + 1)) = (2 + √2) / (2 - 1) = 2 + √2\n\nBut u = 2 + √2 > 1, not in [0,1], so not on the side.\n\nSimilarly for other sides.\n\nPerhaps the square is not with sides at 45°, but the problem says \"aligned with the diagonals\", which are at 45°, so it should be.\n\nPerhaps \"diagonals of the octagon\" means the lines connecting every second vertex, which for a regular octagon are at 0°, 45°, 90°, etc., so the square's sides are parallel to those, so at 0°, 45°, etc.\n\nBut then for the square to have one vertex at (0,0), and sides at 0° and 90°, then it would be axis-aligned, but then its sides are not aligned with the diagonals of the octagon, which are at 45°.\n\nSo it must be that the square's sides are at 45°.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, the square is inscribed such that its sides are parallel to the diagonals, and E is on a side, and by symmetry, we can assume that the square is in the first quadrant, with E on the side from V0 to V1.\n\nLet's assume that for the square, with vertex at (0,0), and sides at 45°, then the center E is at (a,a) for some a, by symmetry, since the square is symmetric.\n\nThen O1E = distance from (0,0) to (a,a) = a√2.\n\nAnd E = (a,a) lies on a side of the octagon.\n\nWhich side? Likely the side from V0 = (R,0) to V1 = (R/√2, R/√2)\n\nSo set (a,a) on the line from (R,0) to (R/√2, R/√2)\n\nThe parametric form: as before, x = R [1 + t(1/√2 - 1)] , y = R t /√2\n\nSet x = y = a:\n\n R [1 + t(1/√2 - 1)] = R t /√2\n\nAs before, this gives 1 + t/√2 - t = t/√2, so 1 - t = 0, t=1, a = R/√2\n\nSo E = (R/√2, R/√2) = V1, a vertex.\n\nBut the problem says \"point E lies on a side\", not on a vertex.\n\nSo perhaps it's on a different side, or perhaps in the diagram, it's on the side, and we need to use the fact that for the square, with vertex at O1, and center at E on a side, and sides aligned with diagonals, then the distance can be found using geometry.\n\nPerhaps use the fact that in a regular octagon, the distance from center to a side (apothem) is known.\n\nFor a regular octagon with side length s, the apothem r = s / (2 tan(π/8)) = 3 / (2 tan(22.5°))\n\n tan(22.5°) = sin(45°)/(1+cos(45°)) = (√2/2) / (1 + √2/2) = (√2/2) / ((2+√2)/2) = √2 / (2+√2) = √2 (2-√2) / ((2+√2)(2-√2)) = √2 (2-√2) / (4-2) = √2 (2-√2) / 2 = (2√2 - 2) / 2 = √2 - 1\n\nSo r = 3 / (2 (√2 - 1)) = 3 (√2 + 1) / (2 (2 - 1)) = 3 (√2 + 1) / 2\n\nSo apothem = 3(√2 + 1)/2\n\nBut this is the distance from center to a side, along the perpendicular.\n\nIn our case, E is on a side, but not necessarily the closest point; it's the center of the square, which is at a distance O1E from center.\n\nIn the square, if one vertex is at O1, and the square is rotated 45°, then the center E is at a distance of (s_sq /2) * √2 = s_sq / √2 from O1, where s_sq is the side length of the square.\n\nBut we don't know s_sq.\n\nPerhaps from the geometry, when E is on the side, and the square is inscribed, then the distance can be found.\n\nPerhaps use coordinates with a different approach.\n\nLet me try to assume that the square has center at E, and one vertex at O1, and sides at 45°, so the vector from O1 to E is along the diagonal of the square, and for the square to have sides at 45°, the diagonal should be along the x or y axis, but then E is on the axis, which only intersects the octagon at vertices.\n\nUnless the square is not with diagonal along the axis, but the sides are at 45°, so the diagonal is at 0° or 90°, so it must be on the axis.\n\nPerhaps \"aligned with the diagonals\" means that the sides are parallel to the lines connecting opposite vertices, which for a regular octagon are at 0°, 45°, 90°, etc., so the square's sides are parallel to those, so at 0°, 45°, etc.\n\nBut then for the square to have one vertex at (0,0), and sides at 0° and 90°, then it would be axis-aligned, but then its sides are not aligned with the diagonals of the octagon, which are at 45°.\n\nSo it must be that the square's sides are at 45°.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, the square is oriented so that its sides are parallel to the diagonals, and E is on a side, and by the symmetry, O1E is along the angle bisector, and we can use trigonometry.\n\nLet's consider the regular octagon. The angle at each vertex is 135°, and the sides are equal.\n\nThe distance from center to a side is the apothem r = 3(1+√2)/2, as calculated.\n\nBut E is not necessarily the foot of the perpendicular; it's the center of the square, which is at a different point.\n\nPerhaps for the square with vertex at O1, and sides at 45°, and E on a side, then the line O1E makes an angle of 22.5° with the side or something.\n\nLet's think of the side of the octagon that E lies on.\n\nSuppose E lies on the side from V0 = (R,0) to V1 = (R/√2, R/√2)\n\nThis side has direction vector (R/√2 - R, R/√2 - 0) = R(1/√2 - 1, 1/√2)\n\nThe length of this side is s = 3, as given.\n\nThe line can be written as parametric or implicit.\n\nThe vector from V0 to V1 is R(1/√2 - 1, 1/√2) = R((1 - √2)/√2, 1/√2) = (R/√2)(1 - √2, 1)\n\nThe magnitude of this vector is the side length 3.\n\nSo | (R/√2)(1 - √2, 1) | = 3\n\nCompute the magnitude: | (1 - √2, 1) | = √[(1 - √2)^2 + 1^2] = √[1 - 2√2 + 2 + 1] = √[4 - 2√2]\n\nSo (R/√2) * √(4 - 2√2) = 3\n\nSo R * √(4 - 2√2) / √2 = 3\n\nR * √(2 - √2) = 3, since √(4 - 2√2) / √2 = √[(4 - 2√2)/2] = √(2 - √2)\n\nSo R = 3 / √(2 - √2), as before.\n\nNow, the line from V0 to V1: from (R,0) to (R/√2, R/√2)\n\nThe parametric form: let t from 0 to 1, x = R + t (R/√2 - R) = R [1 + t(1/√2 - 1)] \n\ny = 0 + t (R/√2) = R t /√2\n\nNow, for the square with vertex at (0,0), and sides at 45°, the center E = (x,y) must be such that the vector (x,y) is along the diagonal of the square, and for the sides to be at 45°, the diagonal should be at 0° or 90°, but as before, that forces x=0 or y=0.\n\nPerhaps for the square, the vector from O1 to E is not along the diagonal, but the sides are at 45°, so the direction from O1 to E should be at 22.5° or something.\n\nLet's assume that by symmetry, E is on the angle bisector, so at 22.5° from the x-axis.\n\nSo let E = (d cos22.5°, d sin22.5°) for some d = O1E.\n\nThen this point lies on the side from V0 to V1.\n\nThe side from V0 to V1 is from (R,0) to (R/√2, R/√2), which is at an angle.\n\nThe direction of the side: from (R,0) to (R/√2, R/√2), the vector is (R/√2 - R, R/√2) = R(1/√2 - 1, 1/√2)\n\nThe angle of this vector: tanθ = (y-component)/(x-component) = (1/√2) / (1/√2 - 1) = 1 / (1 - √2) = -1/(√2 - 1) = - (√2 + 1) \n\nSo θ = arctan(- (√2 + 1)) , which is in second quadrant since x<0, y>0, so θ = 180° + arctan(- (√2 + 1)) = 180° - arctan(√2 + 1)\n\n arctan(√2 + 1) = arctan(2.414) ≈ 67.5°, since tan67.5° = tan(45+22.5) = (1 + tan22.5)/(1 - tan22.5) = (1 + (√2-1))/(1 - (√2-1)) = (√2)/(2-√2) = √2(2+√2)/((2-√2)(2+√2)) = √2(2+√2)/(4-2) = √2(2+√2)/2 = (2√2 + 2)/2 = √2 + 1, yes.\n\nSo θ = 180° - 67.5° = 112.5° for the direction of the side from V0 to V1.\n\nSo the side is at 112.5° from positive x-axis.\n\nNow, the point E = (d cos22.5°, d sin22.5°) lies on this line.\n\nThe line from V0 = (R,0) in direction 112.5°.\n\nThe parametric form: x = R + t cos112.5°, y = 0 + t sin112.5°, for t from 0 to length 3.\n\nBut cos112.5° = cos(180° - 67.5°) = - cos67.5° = - sin22.5° (since cos(90-θ) = sinθ, so cos67.5° = sin22.5°)\n\nSimilarly, sin112.5° = sin(180° - 67.5°) = sin67.5° = cos22.5°\n\nSo x = R + t (- sin22.5°) , y = t cos22.5°\n\nSet equal to E: d cos22.5° = R - t sin22.5° \n\nd sin22.5° = t cos22.5° \n\nFrom the second equation: t = d sin22.5° / cos22.5° = d tan22.5°\n\nPlug into the first:\n\n d cos22.5° = R - (d tan22.5°) sin22.5° \n\n d cos22.5° = R - d (sin22.5° / cos22.5°) * sin22.5° = R - d sin²22.5° / cos22.5° \n\nMultiply both sides by cos22.5°:\n\n d cos²22.5° = R cos22.5° - d sin²22.5° \n\n d (cos²22.5° + sin²22.5°) = R cos22.5° \n\n d * 1 = R cos22.5° \n\nSo d = R cos22.5° \n\nNow R = 3 / √(2 - √2) , as before.\n\n cos22.5° = √[(1 + cos45°)/2] = √[(1 + √2/2)/2] = √[(2 + √2)/4] = √(2 + √2)/2\n\nSo d = [3 / √(2 - √2)] * [√(2 + √2)/2]\n\n = (3/2) * √(2 + √2) / √(2 - √2)\n\n = (3/2) * √[(2 + √2)/(2 - √2)] \n\nRationalize the expression inside: (2 + √2)/(2 - √2) * (2 + √2)/(2 + √2) = (2 + √2)^2 / (4 - 2) = (4 + 4√2 + 2) / 2 = (6 + 4√2)/2 = 3 + 2√2\n\nSo d = (3/2) * √(3 + 2√2)\n\nNow, 3 + 2√2 = (√2 + 1)^2, because (1 + √2)^2 = 1 + 2√2 + 2 = 3 + 2√2\n\nSo √(3 + 2√2) = 1 + √2\n\nTherefore, d = (3/2) * (1 + √2)\n\nSo O1E = \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{2}(1 + \\sqrt{2})}\n\nLet me verify.\n\nWe have d = R cos22.5° , R = 3 / √(2 - √2), cos22.5° = √(2 + √2)/2\n\nSo d = 3 / √(2 - √2) * √(2 + √2)/2 = (3/2) √[(2 + √2)/(2 - √2)] = (3/2) √(3 + 2√2) = (3/2)(1 + √2)\n\nYes.\n\nAnd this makes sense because the apothem is 3(1+√2)/2, which is the same as this, but the apothem is the distance to the side along the perpendicular, while here E is not necessarily the foot, but in this case, since we assumed E is on the angle bisector, and for the square, it might be that in the symmetric position, E is on the angle bisector, and we got d = 3(1+√2)/2, which is exactly the apothem.\n\nBut is E the foot of the perpendicular? In this calculation, we have E at (d cos22.5°, d sin22.5°), and the side is at 112.5°, and the line from O1 to E is at 22.5°, and the side is at 112.5°, so the angle between O1E and the side is 112.5° - 22.5° = 90°, so yes, O1E is perpendicular to the side!\n\nBecause the side is at 112.5°, and O1E is at 22.5°, difference 90°, so it is perpendicular.\n\nTherefore, E is the foot of the perpendicular from O1 to the side, i.e., the apothem point.\n\nAnd for the square, with vertex at O1, and sides at 45°, and center at E, which is on the side, and since O1E is perpendicular to the side, and the square's sides are at 45°, it should be consistent.\n\nIn the square, if one vertex is at O1, and the center is at E, and O1E is perpendicular to the side of the octagon, and the square's sides are at 45° to the octagon's sides, then it should work.\n\nSo the length is the apothem of the octagon.\n\nFor a regular octagon with side length s, apothem r = s / (2 tan(π/8)) = s / (2 tan22.5°) = s / (2(√2 - 1)) = s (√2 + 1) / 2, as before.\n\nWith s=3, r = 3(1 + √2)/2\n\nSo O1E = \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{2}(1 + \\sqrt{2})}\n\nThis is the final answer."
