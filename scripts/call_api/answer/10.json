    "We are given a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3, oriented at 0 radians (i.e., one vertex lies along the positive x-axis). A square is inscribed such that:\n\n- Its center is at point E.\n- Its “radius” (distance from center to vertex) equals that of the octagon.\n- It shares vertex D with the octagon.\n- It extends to include vertices I and K.\n- We are to find the angle ∠I-O1-K — the angle at O1 between points I and K.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nA **regular octagon** has 8 equal sides and 8 equal central angles. The central angle between adjacent vertices is:\n\n> **Central angle = 2π / 8 = π/4 radians**\n\nSince it’s oriented at 0 radians, we can assign angular positions to its vertices starting from the positive x-axis.\n\nLet’s label the octagon’s vertices in counterclockwise order starting from the rightmost vertex (angle 0):\n\n- Vertex A: angle 0\n- Vertex B: angle π/4\n- Vertex C: angle π/2\n- Vertex D: angle 3π/4\n- Vertex E: angle π\n- Vertex F: angle 5π/4\n- Vertex G: angle 3π/2\n- Vertex H: angle 7π/4\n\nWait — but in the diagram, the octagon is labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H — and we’re told that the square shares vertex D with the octagon and extends to include I and K.\n\nAlso, the square’s center is at point E — which in the diagram is a vertex of the octagon. That suggests that **E is both a vertex of the octagon and the center of the square**.\n\nThis is unusual — typically, the center of a square inscribed in a regular octagon would coincide with the octagon’s center O1. But here, the square’s center is at E, a vertex of the octagon.\n\nSo we must interpret this carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Clarify the square’s position\n\nThe square:\n\n- Has center at E (a vertex of the octagon).\n- Has “radius” equal to that of the octagon — meaning the distance from E to each of its vertices (I, D, K, and another) equals the distance from O1 to any vertex of the octagon.\n- Shares vertex D with the octagon.\n- Extends to include vertices I and K.\n\nSo, the square has vertices: D, I, K, and one more (let’s call it L for now), with center at E.\n\nSince E is the center of the square, and D is one vertex, then the vector from E to D is half the diagonal of the square? Wait — no.\n\nIn a square, the center to a vertex is along the diagonal, and the distance from center to vertex is (side * √2)/2 = side / √2.\n\nBut here, it says the “radius” equals that of the octagon — meaning the distance from E to D equals the distance from O1 to any vertex of the octagon.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- R = distance from O1 to any vertex of the octagon (i.e., the circumradius of the octagon).\n- Then, distance from E to D = R.\n\nBut E is itself a vertex of the octagon — so distance from O1 to E is also R.\n\nSo we have triangle O1-E-D, with O1E = R, ED = R, and angle at O1 between E and D is the central angle between two adjacent vertices? Wait — in our labeling, E is at angle π, D is at angle 3π/4 — so angle between them is π - 3π/4 = π/4.\n\nWait — let’s fix the labeling.\n\nActually, looking at the diagram (even though it’s not visible, we can infer from standard labeling and the description), the octagon is labeled A through H, and D is one vertex, E is another, and they are adjacent? Or not?\n\nIn a regular octagon, moving counterclockwise:\n\nIf A is at 0, then:\n\n- A: 0\n- B: π/4\n- C: π/2\n- D: 3π/4\n- E: π\n- F: 5π/4\n- G: 3π/2\n- H: 7π/4\n\nSo D is at 3π/4, E is at π — so angle between O1D and O1E is π - 3π/4 = π/4.\n\nNow, the square has center at E, and vertex D. So vector from E to D is a vector of length R, and direction from E to D.\n\nWhat is the direction from E to D?\n\nE is at angle π (on the negative x-axis), D is at angle 3π/4 (which is 135°, in the second quadrant).\n\nSo the vector from E to D is D - E.\n\nLet’s assign coordinates to make this concrete.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Assign coordinates\n\nLet’s place O1 at the origin (0,0).\n\nLet R be the circumradius of the octagon.\n\nFor a regular octagon with side length s, the circumradius R is given by:\n\n> R = s / (2 * sin(π/8))\n\nSince s = 3,\n\n> R = 3 / (2 * sin(π/8))\n\nBut we may not need the actual value — we can work with angles.\n\nCoordinates of vertices:\n\n- A: (R, 0)\n- B: (R cos(π/4), R sin(π/4)) = (R/√2, R/√2)\n- C: (0, R)\n- D: (R cos(3π/4), R sin(3π/4)) = (-R/√2, R/√2)\n- E: (R cos(π), R sin(π)) = (-R, 0)\n- F: (R cos(5π/4), R sin(5π/4)) = (-R/√2, -R/√2)\n- G: (0, -R)\n- H: (R cos(7π/4), R sin(7π/4)) = (R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nNow, the square has center at E = (-R, 0), and one vertex at D = (-R/√2, R/√2).\n\nLet’s compute the vector from E to D:\n\n> D - E = [ -R/√2 - (-R), R/√2 - 0 ] = [ R(1 - 1/√2), R/√2 ]\n\nThe square has four vertices, each at distance R from center E. Since it’s a square, the other vertices are obtained by rotating this vector by 90°, 180°, 270° around E.\n\nSo, to find vertices I and K, we rotate the vector ED by 90° and 270° (or -90°) around E.\n\nBut which ones are I and K? The problem says the square extends to include I and K, and shares D. So likely, I and K are the two vertices adjacent to D in the square.\n\nIn a square, from center E, the four vertices are at angles θ, θ+90°, θ+180°, θ+270°, where θ is the angle of vector ED.\n\nSo let’s find the angle of vector ED.\n\nVector ED = ( R(1 - 1/√2), R/√2 )\n\nLet’s compute its direction.\n\nLet θ = angle of ED from positive x-axis.\n\ntanθ = (y-component) / (x-component) = [R/√2] / [R(1 - 1/√2)] = (1/√2) / (1 - 1/√2)\n\nSimplify:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √2:\n\n= 1 / (√2 - 1)\n\nRationalize denominator:\n\n= 1 / (√2 - 1) * (√2 + 1)/(√2 + 1) = (√2 + 1) / (2 - 1) = √2 + 1\n\nSo tanθ = √2 + 1\n\nWhat angle has tangent √2 + 1?\n\nRecall that tan(67.5°) = tan(3π/8) = √2 + 1\n\nYes! Because:\n\ntan(2a) = 2tan a / (1 - tan² a)\n\nLet a = 22.5°, then 2a = 45°, tan 45° = 1 = 2t/(1 - t²), solve: t = tan(22.5°) = √2 - 1\n\nThen tan(67.5°) = tan(45° + 22.5°) = (1 + (√2 - 1)) / (1 - 1*(√2 - 1)) = √2 / (2 - √2) = after rationalizing, √2(2 + √2)/ (4 - 2) = (2√2 + 2)/2 = √2 + 1\n\nYes. So θ = 3π/8 radians.\n\nSo vector ED is at angle 3π/8 from positive x-axis.\n\nTherefore, the four vertices of the square are at angles:\n\n- 3π/8\n- 3π/8 + π/2 = 3π/8 + 4π/8 = 7π/8\n- 3π/8 + π = 11π/8\n- 3π/8 + 3π/2 = 3π/8 + 12π/8 = 15π/8\n\nSo the four vertices are at these angles from center E.\n\nBut we need their positions relative to O1 to find angle I-O1-K.\n\nThe problem says the square includes vertices I and K — and shares D. So D is one vertex, say at 3π/8 from E.\n\nThen the adjacent vertices in the square would be at 7π/8 and 15π/8 from E.\n\nSo I and K are at 7π/8 and 15π/8 from E.\n\nNow, we need to find the positions of I and K in the coordinate system centered at O1, then find the angle between vectors O1I and O1K.\n\nSo let’s compute coordinates of I and K.\n\nFirst, recall E is at (-R, 0)\n\nVertex I: at angle 7π/8 from E, distance R from E.\n\nSo coordinates of I:\n\n> x_I = x_E + R * cos(7π/8)\n> y_I = y_E + R * sin(7π/8)\n\nSimilarly for K at 15π/8:\n\n> x_K = x_E + R * cos(15π/8)\n> y_K = y_E + R * sin(15π/8)\n\nNow, cos(7π/8) = cos(157.5°) = -cos(22.5°) = -√[(1 + cos(45°))/2] = -√[(1 + √2/2)/2] = -√[(2 + √2)/4] = -√(2 + √2)/2\n\nSimilarly, sin(7π/8) = sin(157.5°) = sin(22.5°) = √[(1 - cos(45°))/2] = √[(1 - √2/2)/2] = √[(2 - √2)/4] = √(2 - √2)/2\n\ncos(15π/8) = cos(337.5°) = cos(-22.5°) = cos(22.5°) = √(2 + √2)/2\n\nsin(15π/8) = sin(337.5°) = -sin(22.5°) = -√(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo:\n\nI: x_I = -R + R * cos(7π/8) = -R + R * [ -√(2 + √2)/2 ] = -R [1 + √(2 + √2)/2 ]\n\nWait, better to factor:\n\nx_I = -R + R * cos(7π/8) = R [ -1 + cos(7π/8) ]\n\nSimilarly,\n\ny_I = 0 + R * sin(7π/8) = R * sin(7π/8)\n\nSimilarly for K:\n\nx_K = -R + R * cos(15π/8) = R [ -1 + cos(15π/8) ]\n\ny_K = R * sin(15π/8)\n\nNow, we need vectors O1I and O1K, which are just the position vectors of I and K, since O1 is at (0,0).\n\nSo vector O1I = (x_I, y_I) = R [ -1 + cos(7π/8), sin(7π/8) ]\n\nVector O1K = (x_K, y_K) = R [ -1 + cos(15π/8), sin(15π/8) ]\n\nNow, the angle φ between them is given by:\n\ncosφ = (O1I • O1K) / (|O1I| |O1K|)\n\nBut since both vectors have the same magnitude? Not necessarily — but we can compute the dot product.\n\nFirst, note that cos(15π/8) = cos(-π/8) = cos(π/8) = √(2 + √2)/2\n\nsin(15π/8) = -sin(π/8) = -√(2 - √2)/2\n\ncos(7π/8) = -cos(π/8) = -√(2 + √2)/2\n\nsin(7π/8) = sin(π/8) = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo let’s define:\n\nLet c = cos(π/8) = √(2 + √2)/2\n\ns = sin(π/8) = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nThen:\n\nO1I = R [ -1 - c, s ]\n\nO1K = R [ -1 + c, -s ]\n\nNow, dot product O1I • O1K = R² [ (-1 - c)(-1 + c) + (s)(-s) ]\n\nCompute:\n\n(-1 - c)(-1 + c) = (-1)^2 - c^2 = 1 - c^2\n\n(s)(-s) = -s^2\n\nSo dot product = R² [1 - c^2 - s^2]\n\nBut c^2 + s^2 = cos²(π/8) + sin²(π/8) = 1\n\nSo dot product = R² [1 - 1] = 0\n\nOh! The dot product is 0.\n\nThat means the vectors O1I and O1K are perpendicular!\n\nSo angle between them is π/2 radians.\n\nIs that possible? Let me double-check.\n\nWe have:\n\nO1I = R(-1 - c, s)\n\nO1K = R(-1 + c, -s)\n\nDot product: (-1 - c)(-1 + c) + (s)(-s) = [1 - c^2] - s^2 = 1 - (c^2 + s^2) = 1 - 1 = 0\n\nYes, exactly.\n\nSo the angle ∠I-O1-K is π/2 radians.\n\nBut the problem asks for it as a multiple of π, so π/2.\n\nBut let me make sure that I and K are indeed the vertices we think.\n\nThe square has vertices at angles 3π/8, 7π/8, 11π/8, 15π/8 from center E.\n\nD is at 3π/8, so adjacent vertices are at 7π/8 and 15π/8 — yes, those are I and K.\n\nAnd we found that vectors from O1 to I and K are perpendicular.\n\nSo the angle is π/2.\n\nBut is this intuitive? Let me think geometrically.\n\nThe square is centered at E, a vertex of the octagon, and has the same \"radius\" as the octagon. So it's like a square rotated and placed such that one vertex is at D, center at E.\n\nThe points I and K are symmetric with respect to the line from O1 to E? Or something.\n\nSince the dot product is zero, it's confirmed.\n\nSo the answer is π/2.\n\nBut let me check if the problem might have meant something else.\n\nThe problem says: \"angle I-O1-K be the angle formed at O1 by segments O1I and O1K.\"\n\nYes, and we found it to be π/2.\n\nAnd expressed as a multiple of π, it's \\frac{1}{2} \\pi.\n\nSo final answer: \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}}\n\nBut wait — the problem says \"expressed as a multiple of π\", so perhaps just \\boxed{\\frac{1}{2}}? No, it says \"radian measure ... expressed as a multiple of π\", so probably \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}} is fine, but to be precise, if they want the coefficient, it might be 1/2.\n\nLooking back: \"Find the radian measure of angle I-O1-K, expressed as a multiple of π.\"\n\nSo, for example, if it were π, they’d say 1; if π/2, they’d say 1/2.\n\nIn many contexts, \"expressed as a multiple of π\" means to give the coefficient.\n\nFor example, \"express 90 degrees as a multiple of π\" — answer is π/2, or 0.5π, so coefficient is 0.5 or 1/2.\n\nSo probably they want \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}\n\nBut to be safe, let me see the wording: \"expressed as a multiple of π\" — so the angle is kπ, find k.\n\nIn this case, angle is π/2, so k = 1/2.\n\nYes.\n\nIn the box, I should put \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}\n\nBut let me confirm once more.\n\nIs there any chance I misidentified I and K?\n\nThe square shares vertex D with the octagon and extends to include I and K. In a square, from D, the two adjacent vertices are I and K. We took them as at 7π/8 and 15π/8 from E, which are correct.\n\nAnd we computed the angle at O1 between them and got 90 degrees.\n\nGeometrically, since the square is symmetric, and E is on the octagon, and the square is rotated, it makes sense that I and K are symmetric in some way that makes the angle at O1 be right angle.\n\nAnother way: the vectors O1I and O1K are perpendicular, as dot product is zero.\n\nSo I think it's correct.\n\nFinal answer: \\boxed{\\dfrac{1}{2}}"
