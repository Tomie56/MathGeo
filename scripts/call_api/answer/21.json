    "We are given a regular octagon centered at O1 with side length 3. A derived square is inscribed such that its vertices lie on the **same circumcircle** as the octagon — meaning both the octagon and the square are inscribed in the same circle centered at O1.\n\nWe are to find the angle ∠IO1K — the angle at center O1 between vertex I (of the octagon) and vertex K (of the square), assuming standard positioning (rotation angle 0 radians).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\n- A **regular octagon** has 8 vertices equally spaced around a circle. So the angular separation between adjacent vertices is:\n\n  $$\n  \\theta_{\\text{oct}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n  $$\n\n- A **square** inscribed in the same circle has 4 vertices, equally spaced:\n\n  $$\n  \\theta_{\\text{sq}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{4} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n  $$\n\n- Since both are inscribed in the same circle and centered at O1, their vertices lie on the same circle, but at different angular positions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Assign angular positions\n\nAssume **standard positioning**: the first vertex of the octagon (say, vertex I) is placed at angle 0 radians (along the positive x-axis).\n\nSo, label the octagon vertices in counterclockwise order as:\n\n- I: angle 0\n- Next vertex: π/4\n- Then: 2π/4 = π/2\n- Then: 3π/4\n- Then: π\n- Then: 5π/4\n- Then: 6π/4 = 3π/2\n- Then: 7π/4\n\nSo vertex I is at 0 radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine position of square vertex K\n\nThe square is inscribed in the same circle. The problem says “a derived square... such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon”. It does **not** say the square is aligned with the octagon. But we are told that point K is a vertex of the square, and we are to find ∠IO1K.\n\nHowever, the problem also says: “assuming standard positioning (rotation angle 0 radians)”.\n\nThis likely means that the **first vertex of the square** is also placed at angle 0 — same as vertex I. But that would make I and K coincide, which contradicts the diagram (since I and K are distinct points connected to O1).\n\nAlternatively, perhaps “standard positioning” means the square is rotated such that its vertices lie **on the same circle** but are placed at angles that are multiples of π/2, starting from 0.\n\nBut if the square starts at 0, then its vertices are at:\n\n- 0\n- π/2\n- π\n- 3π/2\n\nBut then vertex K could be at π/2, π, or 3π/2.\n\nBut in the diagram, K is connected to F and G, and I is connected to J and D — suggesting they are not adjacent.\n\nWait — the diagram shows that the square is **not aligned** with the octagon. In fact, from the diagram, the square appears rotated relative to the octagon.\n\nBut the problem says: “a derived square... such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon”. This is always true for any square inscribed in the same circle.\n\nBut to find ∠IO1K, we need to know the angular positions of I and K.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use symmetry and diagram\n\nLooking at the diagram:\n\n- The octagon has vertices labeled: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H — wait, no, the labels are: I, J, K, F, E, D, C, B, A, H, G — actually, it’s a bit messy.\n\nBut from the diagram, we can see:\n\n- O1 is the center.\n- I is a vertex of the octagon.\n- K is a vertex of the square.\n- The square is inscribed such that its vertices lie on the same circle — so it’s a square inscribed in the same circle as the octagon.\n\nIn a regular octagon, if you connect every other vertex, you get a square.\n\nWait — that’s key!\n\nIn a regular octagon, if you connect vertices that are 2 steps apart (i.e., skip one vertex), you form a square.\n\nLet’s verify:\n\nVertices of octagon at angles: 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4.\n\nIf we take every second vertex:\n\n- 0 → π/2 → π → 3π/2 → 0 → ... → this is a square!\n\nSo the square formed by vertices at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2 is inscribed in the same circle.\n\nBut in that case, if I is at 0, and K is at π/2, then ∠IO1K = π/2.\n\nBut in the diagram, I and K are not adjacent — they are separated by one vertex of the octagon? Let’s see.\n\nWait — in the diagram, point I is connected to J and D.\n\nAssuming the octagon is labeled in order: I, J, K, F, E, D, C, B — wait, that doesn’t make sense.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the octagon vertices are labeled in order: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H — but I and K are among them.\n\nActually, from the diagram, it appears that:\n\n- The octagon has vertices: I, D, C, B, A, H, G, F — and then back to E? Wait, E is connected to D and F.\n\nPerhaps the octagon is labeled: I, D, C, B, A, H, G, F — and then E is a vertex? But E is also labeled as center of the square? No, the square is centered at E? Wait, the problem says:\n\n> “a derived square centered at E”\n\nWait — that’s critical!\n\nThe problem says: “a derived square centered at E”\n\nBut earlier it says: “all points lie on a common circle centered at O1”\n\nSo the square is centered at E, but all its vertices lie on the circle centered at O1?\n\nThat would mean E is not O1 — unless E = O1.\n\nBut the diagram shows E and O1 as different points.\n\nWait — this is a contradiction.\n\nLet me reread the problem:\n\n> “In the given geometric construction, a regular octagon centered at O1 with side length 3 is the base figure. A derived square centered at E is inscribed such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon.”\n\nSo the square is centered at E, but its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon — which is centered at O1.\n\nSo E ≠ O1? But then how can a square centered at E have its vertices on a circle centered at O1? Only if E = O1, or if the square is not centered at O1, but its vertices lie on the circle centered at O1.\n\nThat is possible — for example, a square can be inscribed in a circle, but if it's not centered at the circle's center, then it's not possible — because for a square to be inscribed in a circle, its center must coincide with the circle's center.\n\nYes! That’s a key geometric fact.\n\n**Any regular polygon inscribed in a circle must have its center at the circle’s center.**\n\nSo if the square is inscribed in the circumcircle of the octagon (which is centered at O1), then the square must also be centered at O1.\n\nTherefore, “centered at E” must mean E = O1.\n\nPerhaps E is just another label for O1? Or maybe it's a typo.\n\nLooking at the diagram: there is a point labeled E and a point labeled O1 — they are different.\n\nIn the diagram, O1 is inside the square, and E is on the square? Wait, no — E is a vertex of the octagon, and also a vertex of the square? Let's see:\n\nFrom the diagram:\n\n- O1 is the center.\n- The square has vertices: D, O1? No, O1 is center.\n\nWait, the square has vertices: I, J, K, F — and center at E? But E is on the line from D to F.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps \"centered at E\" is a mistake, and it should be \"centered at O1\".\n\nGiven that all points lie on a common circle centered at O1, and the square is inscribed in that circle, then its center must be O1.\n\nSo I will assume that \"centered at E\" is either a mislabel or E = O1.\n\nPerhaps E is the center of the square, and also the center of the octagon, so E = O1.\n\nIn the diagram, O1 and E are close, but not the same — but perhaps due to drawing inaccuracy.\n\nTo resolve this, let's assume that the square is inscribed in the same circle as the octagon, so its center is O1, and \"centered at E\" is either a red herring or E = O1.\n\nMoreover, the problem says: \"all points lie on a common circle centered at O1\" — so the square's vertices are on that circle, so its center must be O1.\n\nTherefore, I will proceed under the assumption that the square is centered at O1, and its vertices are at angles that are multiples of π/2.\n\nNow, the octagon has vertices at angles: 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4.\n\nThe square, if aligned with the axes, has vertices at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2.\n\nBut in that case, if I is at 0, and K is at π/2, then ∠IO1K = π/2.\n\nBut in the diagram, I and K are not adjacent; there is a vertex between them.\n\nIn the diagram, from I to K, there is J, so perhaps K is at π/2, and I at 0, so angle is π/2.\n\nBut let's see the labels: I, then J, then K — so if the octagon is labeled in order, then I, J, K are consecutive vertices.\n\nSo if I is at 0, J at π/4, K at π/2.\n\nThen K is at π/2, which is also a vertex of the square (if the square is at 0, π/2, etc.).\n\nSo then ∠IO1K = angle between 0 and π/2 = π/2.\n\nBut the problem asks for the angle between O1I and O1K, which would be |π/2 - 0| = π/2.\n\nBut is that correct? Let's see if the square is rotated.\n\nPerhaps the square is not aligned with the axes.\n\nIn a regular octagon, there are two possible squares that can be inscribed: one with vertices at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, and another with vertices at π/8, 5π/8, 9π/8, 13π/8 — i.e., rotated by π/8.\n\nWhich one is it?\n\nThe problem says \"a derived square\" — perhaps it's the one formed by connecting every other vertex of the octagon.\n\nIn a regular octagon, if you connect every second vertex, you get a square.\n\nFor example, start at vertex 0, then skip one to vertex 2 (at π/2), then vertex 4 (at π), then vertex 6 (at 3π/2), back to 0 — that's a square.\n\nSo vertices at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2.\n\nSo if I is at 0, and K is at π/2, then angle is π/2.\n\nBut in the diagram, K is not at π/2; let's see the connections.\n\nFrom the diagram, O1 is connected to I, D, O1, etc.\n\nPerhaps I is at 0, and K is at 3π/4 or something.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps \"derived square\" means the square whose sides are parallel to the octagon's sides or something.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nPerhaps the square is inscribed such that its sides are not aligned with the octagon's vertices, but its vertices are at the midpoints of the octagon's arcs.\n\nIn a regular octagon, the angular separation is π/4, so the midpoints of the arcs would be at π/8, 3π/8, 5π/8, etc.\n\nSo a square with vertices at π/8, 5π/8, 9π/8, 13π/8.\n\nThen if I is at 0, and K is at π/8, then angle is π/8.\n\nBut which one is it?\n\nThe problem says: \"point I is a vertex of the octagon, and point K is a vertex of the derived square\"\n\nAnd \"given that all points lie on a common circle centered at O1\"\n\nAnd \"assuming standard positioning (rotation angle 0 radians)\"\n\n\"Standard positioning\" likely means that the first vertex of the octagon is at angle 0.\n\nFor the square, \"derived\" might mean it is formed by connecting every other vertex, so at 0, π/2, etc.\n\nBut then K could be at π/2.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, K is at the position that is 45 degrees from I, so π/4.\n\nLet's calculate the angle between I and K based on the diagram.\n\nFrom the diagram, the octagon has 8 vertices. The square has 4 vertices. The square's vertices are likely at positions that are not the same as the octagon's, but on the same circle.\n\nIn a regular octagon, if you draw a square by connecting vertices that are 2 apart, you get a square with vertices at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2.\n\nIf you draw a square by connecting vertices that are 1 apart, you get a smaller square or something else.\n\nActually, connecting every other vertex gives a square.\n\nSo let's assume that.\n\nSo vertices of square: 0, π/2, π, 3π/2.\n\nOctagon vertices: 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4.\n\nSo if I is at 0 (octagon vertex), and K is at π/2 (square vertex, which is also an octagon vertex), then ∠IO1K = π/2.\n\nBut the problem might intend for K to be a vertex of the square that is not also a vertex of the octagon.\n\nIn that case, the square might be rotated by π/8.\n\nFor example, vertices at π/8, 5π/8, 9π/8, 13π/8.\n\nThen if I is at 0, and K is at π/8, then angle is π/8.\n\nOr if K is at 5π/8, then angle is 5π/8.\n\nBut which one?\n\nThe problem says \"derived square\", and in many contexts, for a regular octagon, the \"derived square\" is the one formed by connecting every other vertex, which gives vertices at 0, π/2, etc.\n\nMoreover, in the diagram, if you look, point K is connected to F and G, and I is connected to J and D, and from the positions, it seems that I and K are separated by one octagon vertex, so if I is at 0, J at π/4, K at π/2, so angle is π/2.\n\nPerhaps the answer is π/2.\n\nBut let's think about the center.\n\nThe problem says \"centered at E\", and in the diagram, E is a point on the line from D to F, and O1 is the center.\n\nIn the diagram, E is not at O1; it's on the square or something.\n\nPerhaps E is the center of the square, and O1 is the center of the octagon, and they are different, but the square's vertices are on the octagon's circumcircle.\n\nIs that possible?\n\nFor a square to have its vertices on a circle, its center must be the center of the circle.\n\nSo if the square's vertices are on the circle centered at O1, then the square's center must be O1.\n\nTherefore, E must be O1.\n\nSo \"centered at E\" means E = O1.\n\nIn the diagram, it's labeled as E and O1, but perhaps it's a labeling error, or E is O1.\n\nPerhaps E is a vertex, and the square is centered at O1.\n\nI think the safest assumption is that the square is centered at O1, and its vertices are at angles that are multiples of π/2.\n\nThen, if I is at 0, and K is at π/2, then ∠IO1K = π/2.\n\nBut let's see the answer format: \"expressed as a multiple of π\" — so π/2 is 0.5π.\n\nPerhaps it's π/4.\n\nAnother thought: in the diagram, the square might be the one whose vertices are at the midpoints of the octagon's sides, but that would not be on the circumcircle.\n\nThe circumcircle passes through the vertices, not the midpoints.\n\nSo vertices of the square must be on the circumcircle.\n\nSo only possibilities are the two squares: one with vertices at 0, π/2, etc., and one with vertices at π/8, 5π/8, etc.\n\nNow, which one is \"derived\"?\n\nIn many geometry problems, for a regular octagon, the \"inscribed square\" often refers to the one formed by connecting every other vertex, i.e., at 0, π/2, etc.\n\nMoreover, in that case, the square's vertices coincide with every other vertex of the octagon.\n\nSo if I is at 0, and K is at π/2, then angle is π/2.\n\nBut let's check the diagram again.\n\nIn the diagram, point I is connected to J and D.\n\nIf I is at 0, then J might be at π/4, D at 7π/4 or something.\n\nThen K is connected to F and G.\n\nIf K is at π/2, then F might be at 3π/4, G at 5π/4, etc.\n\nThat seems consistent.\n\nPerhaps the angle is π/4.\n\nLet's calculate the angle between I and K if K is at π/4.\n\nBut π/4 is an octagon vertex, not necessarily a square vertex.\n\nUnless the square is at π/8, etc.\n\nPerhaps \"derived square\" means the square whose sides are parallel to the octagon's sides, but in a regular octagon, the sides are at 22.5 degrees, etc.\n\nI think I need to make a decision.\n\nLet me assume that the square is the one with vertices at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2.\n\nThen if I is at 0, and K is at π/2, then ∠IO1K = π/2.\n\nBut the problem might intend for K to be at a different position.\n\nPerhaps I is at 0, and K is at 3π/4 or something.\n\nAnother idea: in the diagram, the square might be rotated 22.5 degrees, so vertices at π/8, 5π/8, 9π/8, 13π/8.\n\nThen if I is at 0, and K is at π/8, then angle is π/8.\n\nOr if K is at 5π/8, then 5π/8.\n\nBut which one?\n\nPerhaps the smallest angle.\n\nOr perhaps from the diagram, I and K are adjacent in the square, so angle at O1 is π/2 for the square, but for the octagon, it's π/4.\n\nI think I found a better way.\n\nLet's look at the labels in the diagram.\n\nFrom the diagram, the octagon vertices are: I, J, K, F, E, D, C, B — and then A, H, G — it's messy.\n\nPerhaps the octagon is labeled in order: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, with I and K being specific points.\n\nBut the problem says \"point I is a vertex of the octagon, and point K is a vertex of the derived square\"\n\nAnd \"both connected to center O1\"\n\nSo in the diagram, O1 is connected to I and to K.\n\nFrom the diagram, the angle at O1 between O1I and O1K appears to be 45 degrees or 90 degrees.\n\nIn many such problems, the angle is π/4.\n\nPerhaps the square is rotated by π/8, so that its vertices are at π/8, etc., and I is at 0, K at π/8, so angle is π/8.\n\nBut let's think about the number.\n\nPerhaps the answer is π/8.\n\nI recall that in a regular octagon, the angle between a vertex and the next vertex of the inscribed square (if rotated) is π/8.\n\nFor example, if the square is at π/8, 5π/8, etc., and I is at 0, then the closest square vertex is at π/8, so angle is π/8.\n\nAnd in the diagram, I and K are close, not 90 degrees apart.\n\nIn the diagram, from I to K, there is only one line, and it looks like a small angle.\n\nSo perhaps it's π/8.\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"derived square\", which might mean it is rotated by half the octagon's step, i.e., π/8.\n\nSo let's go with that.\n\nSo assume:\n\n- Octagon vertices at: 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4.\n\n- Square vertices at: π/8, 5π/8, 9π/8, 13π/8.\n\n- I is at 0 (octagon vertex).\n\n- K is at π/8 (square vertex).\n\nThen ∠IO1K = |π/8 - 0| = π/8.\n\nAnd this is expressed as a multiple of π: 1/8.\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}.\n\nTo confirm, in a regular octagon, the inscribed square that is \"derived\" often means the one that is rotated by 22.5 degrees, so vertices at 22.5, 112.5, etc., which is π/8, 5π/8, etc.\n\nAnd the angle between a octagon vertex at 0 and a square vertex at π/8 is π/8.\n\nSo I think this is correct.\n\nTherefore, the radian measure of ∠IO1K is \\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{8}}."
