    "We are given a geometric construction involving a **regular octagon** centered at **O1**, with side length **3**, and a **square** centered at **E**, with **radius equal to that of the octagon**, and one of its vertices at **O1**. Point **H** is a vertex of the octagon. Line **L1** passes through points **D** and **F** (vertices of the square). We are to find the **distance from H to the foot of the perpendicular** from H to line L1 — that is, the length **HF₀**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nWe are told:\n\n- Regular octagon centered at O1, side length = 3.\n- Square centered at E, with radius equal to that of the octagon (so same circumradius), and one vertex at O1.\n- H is a vertex of the octagon.\n- D and F are vertices of the square → line L1 = line DF.\n- Drop perpendicular from H to L1, meeting it at F₀ → find HF₀.\n\nThis is a coordinate geometry problem. We’ll assign coordinates to make this precise.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Place the octagon centered at origin\n\nLet’s place **O1 at the origin (0,0)** for simplicity.\n\nA regular octagon centered at the origin with side length **s = 3** has a known **circumradius R**.\n\n### Formula for circumradius R of regular octagon with side length s:\n\nFor a regular octagon, the circumradius R is:\n\n> R = s / (2 sin(π/8))\n\nWe compute sin(π/8):\n\nπ/8 = 22.5°\n\nsin(22.5°) = sin(45°/2) = √[(1 - cos(45°))/2] = √[(1 - √2/2)/2] = √[(2 - √2)/4] = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo:\n\nR = 3 / [2 * √(2 - √2)/2] = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nLet’s rationalize or simplify this later if needed. For now, we can leave it symbolic or compute numerically.\n\nBut perhaps better: we can assign coordinates to the octagon vertices directly.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Assign coordinates to octagon vertices\n\nLet’s label the octagon vertices in counterclockwise order as **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H**, starting from the rightmost vertex (angle 0°).\n\nIn a regular octagon centered at origin, vertices are at angles:\n\nθ_k = 2πk/8 = πk/4, for k = 0 to 7.\n\nSo:\n\n- Vertex 0: angle 0° → (R, 0)\n- Vertex 1: 45° → (R cos45°, R sin45°)\n- Vertex 2: 90° → (0, R)\n- Vertex 3: 135° → (-R cos45°, R sin45°)\n- Vertex 4: 180° → (-R, 0)\n- Vertex 5: 225° → (-R cos45°, -R sin45°)\n- Vertex 6: 270° → (0, -R)\n- Vertex 7: 315° → (R cos45°, -R sin45°)\n\nWe are told **H is a vertex of the octagon**. But which one? The diagram labels H as one vertex, and also labels E as center of the square.\n\nLooking at the diagram labels:\n\nVertices labeled: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, and O1.\n\nWait — the octagon has 8 vertices. The square has 4. The diagram seems to have overlapping labels.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\n> A square centered at E, with radius equal to that of the octagon, is derived by placing one of its vertices at the center O1.\n\nSo the square has **same circumradius R** as the octagon, and one of its vertices is at **O1 (0,0)**.\n\nThat’s unusual — normally, for a square centered at E, the vertices are at distance R from E. But here, one vertex is at O1, and the center is at E.\n\nSo, if the square has center E, and one vertex is at O1, then the vector from E to O1 is a radius vector of the square.\n\nIn a square, the distance from center to vertex is R (same as octagon’s circumradius).\n\nSo, the center E is located such that **|E - O1| = R**, and the direction is along one of the square’s diagonals.\n\nSince the square is rotated relative to the octagon, we need to figure out its orientation.\n\nBut the problem also says: **line L1 passes through D and F (vertices of the square)**.\n\nAnd we are to drop a perpendicular from H (a vertex of the octagon) to line DF, and find the distance.\n\nThis is getting complex without a clear diagram. But since we are told that the square has **one vertex at O1**, and center at E, and same radius R, we can deduce the square’s orientation.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Determine square’s orientation\n\nLet’s assume the square is oriented such that its sides are at 45° to the axes — which is common when one vertex is at (R,0) and center at origin. But here, **one vertex is at O1 (0,0)**, and center is at E.\n\nSo, let’s suppose the square has vertices at:\n\nLet’s denote the square’s vertices as P0, P1, P2, P3, with P0 = O1 = (0,0).\n\nSince the center is E, and the square has circumradius R, then E is located at distance R from P0, along the direction of the diagonal.\n\nIn a square, the center is at the intersection of diagonals. So if one vertex is at (0,0), and center is at E, then the opposite vertex is at 2E.\n\nThe vector from center to vertex is (P0 - E), and |P0 - E| = R.\n\nSo, let’s suppose the square is oriented with diagonals along the x and y axes for simplicity? But then if one vertex is at (0,0), center would be at (R/√2, R/√2) or something.\n\nWait — in a square, the distance from center to vertex is R. The diagonal of the square is 2R.\n\nSo side length of square = 2R / √2 = R√2.\n\nBut we don’t need side length.\n\nLet’s place the square.\n\nAssume the square has vertices at:\n\nLet’s let the center E be at (R, 0). Then one vertex would be at (R + R, 0) = (2R, 0), but we want one vertex at (0,0).\n\nSo if center is at E, and vertex at O1 = (0,0), then E must be located such that vector from E to O1 has length R.\n\nSo E lies on the circle of radius R around O1.\n\nBut also, since it’s a square, the other vertices are obtained by rotating this vector by 90°, 180°, 270° around E.\n\nSo let’s define:\n\nLet vector from E to O1 be **v** = O1 - E, with |v| = R.\n\nThen the other vertices are:\n\n- O1 = E + v\n- P1 = E + i*v (rotated 90°)\n- P2 = E - v\n- P3 = E - i*v\n\nIn complex numbers, if we treat points as complex numbers, and rotation by 90° is multiplication by i.\n\nSo let’s use complex numbers for simplicity.\n\nLet O1 = 0 (origin).\n\nLet E be a complex number such that |0 - E| = R → |E| = R.\n\nSo E = R e^{iθ} for some θ.\n\nThen the four vertices of the square are:\n\n- V0 = E + (O1 - E) = O1 = 0\n- V1 = E + i*(O1 - E) = E + i*(-E) = E(1 - i)\n- V2 = E + (-1)*(O1 - E) = E - (-E) = 2E\n- V3 = E + (-i)*(O1 - E) = E + (-i)*(-E) = E(1 + i)\n\nSo the four vertices are: 0, E(1 - i), 2E, E(1 + i)\n\nNow, the problem says: line L1 passes through D and F — vertices of the square.\n\nSo D and F are two of these four points.\n\nAlso, the square is centered at E, and we are to find the perpendicular from H (a vertex of the octagon) to line DF.\n\nBut we need to know which vertices D and F are.\n\nLooking at the diagram labels: points D and F are labeled, and also E is the center of the square.\n\nIn the diagram, it seems that D and F are adjacent vertices of the square? Or opposite?\n\nBut in a square, if you connect two vertices, it could be a side or a diagonal.\n\nThe line L1 is DF. The foot of perpendicular from H to L1 is F₀.\n\nTo proceed, we need to fix the orientation.\n\nPerhaps the square is oriented such that its sides are parallel to the octagon’s sides? But the octagon has sides at 0°, 45°, etc.\n\nAnother idea: since the octagon has vertices at angles k*45°, and the square has vertices at 0, E(1-i), 2E, E(1+i), we can choose θ so that the square is rotated 22.5° or something to match.\n\nBut this is getting too abstract.\n\nPerhaps we can assume a specific orientation that makes calculation easy.\n\nLet’s assume that the square is oriented with its diagonals along the x and y axes. But then if one vertex is at (0,0), the center would be at (R/√2, R/√2) or something.\n\nLet’s try this:\n\nSuppose the square has vertices at:\n\n- (0,0)\n- (a,a)\n- (2a,0)\n- (a,-a)\n\nThen the center is at (a,0), and distance from center to (0,0) is √(a² + 0²) = a, so R = a.\n\nThen vertices are:\n\n- V0 = (0,0)\n- V1 = (a,a)\n- V2 = (2a,0)\n- V3 = (a,-a)\n\nCenter E = (a,0)\n\nDistance from E to V0: √((a-0)^2 + (0-0)^2) = a = R, good.\n\nDistance from E to V1: √((a-a)^2 + (0-a)^2) = a, good.\n\nSo this works.\n\nSo let’s set:\n\n- O1 = (0,0)\n- E = (R, 0)\n- Square vertices: (0,0), (R,R), (2R,0), (R,-R)\n\nNow, the problem says \"line L1 is the line passing through points D and F (vertices of the square)\".\n\nIn the diagram, D and F are labeled. Looking at the diagram, D is connected to I and C, and F is connected to K and G. Also, E is between D and F? Not sure.\n\nBut in our square, vertices are (0,0), (R,R), (2R,0), (R,-R)\n\nLet’s assume D and F are (R,R) and (R,-R). Then line DF is the vertical line x = R.\n\nThat would be simple.\n\nOr if D and F are (0,0) and (2R,0), then line DF is the x-axis.\n\nBut then perpendicular from H to it would be vertical or horizontal.\n\nLet’s look at the diagram again.\n\nIn the diagram, points D and F are not on the same horizontal or vertical; they are diagonal.\n\nIn our square, if we take D = (R,R) and F = (R,-R), then DF is vertical.\n\nIf we take D = (0,0) and F = (2R,0), DF is horizontal.\n\nIf we take D = (0,0) and F = (R,R), then DF is y = x.\n\nSimilarly, (0,0) and (R,-R) is y = -x.\n\nPerhaps the most symmetric is to take D and F as (R,R) and (R,-R), so DF is x = R.\n\nThen line L1 is x = R.\n\nThen we need to find the distance from H (a vertex of the octagon) to this line.\n\nThe distance from a point (x0,y0) to line x = R is |x0 - R|.\n\nSo if we can find the x-coordinate of H, we can find the distance.\n\nBut what is H? A vertex of the octagon.\n\nThe octagon is centered at O1 = (0,0), side length 3.\n\nWe need to find the coordinates of its vertices.\n\nAs before, vertices at angles k*45°, with radius R_oct = 3 / (2 sin(π/8)) = 3 / (2 * sin(22.5°))\n\nCompute sin(22.5°) = sin(45°/2) = √((1 - cos45°)/2) = √((1 - √2/2)/2) = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo R_oct = 3 / [2 * √(2 - √2)/2] = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √(2 + √2):\n\nR_oct = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √[(2 - √2)(2 + √2)] = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √(4 - 2) = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2 = (3/√2) * √(2 + √2)\n\nSimplify: (3/√2) * √(2 + √2) = 3 * √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = 3 * √(1 + √2/2)\n\nBut perhaps keep as R = 3 / √(2 - √2) for now.\n\nNumerically, let's calculate R.\n\n√2 ≈ 1.4142\n\n2 - √2 ≈ 2 - 1.4142 = 0.5858\n\n√(0.5858) ≈ 0.7654\n\nSo R ≈ 3 / 0.7654 ≈ 3.919\n\nBut let's keep symbolic.\n\nNow, the vertices of the octagon are at (R cos( k*45°), R sin( k*45°)) for k=0 to 7.\n\nLet’s list them:\n\nk=0: (R, 0) — let's call this A\n\nk=1: (R cos45, R sin45) = (R/√2, R/√2) — B\n\nk=2: (0, R) — C\n\nk=3: (-R/√2, R/√2) — D\n\nk=4: (-R, 0) — E\n\nk=5: (-R/√2, -R/√2) — F\n\nk=6: (0, -R) — G\n\nk=7: (R/√2, -R/√2) — H\n\nThe problem says \"H is a vertex of the octagon\", and in the diagram, H is labeled, and from the position, it might be the bottom-right vertex, which is k=7: (R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nSo let's assume H = (R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nNow, back to the square.\n\nWe have square with vertices: (0,0), (R,R), (2R,0), (R,-R), center at (R,0)\n\nThe problem says line L1 passes through D and F — vertices of the square.\n\nIn the diagram, D and F are likely (R,R) and (R,-R), so line DF is x = R.\n\nThen the distance from H = (R/√2, -R/√2) to line x = R is |R/√2 - R| = R |1/√2 - 1| = R (1 - 1/√2) since 1/√2 < 1.\n\nSo HF₀ = R (1 - 1/√2)\n\nNow R = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nSo HF₀ = [3 / √(2 - √2)] * (1 - 1/√2)\n\nLet’s simplify this expression.\n\nFirst, 1 - 1/√2 = (√2 - 1)/√2\n\nSo HF₀ = 3 * (√2 - 1)/√2 / √(2 - √2) = 3 (√2 - 1) / [ √2 * √(2 - √2) ]\n\nSimplify the denominator: √2 * √(2 - √2) = √[2(2 - √2)] = √(4 - 2√2)\n\nSo HF₀ = 3 (√2 - 1) / √(4 - 2√2)\n\nNow, simplify √(4 - 2√2)\n\nSuspect that 4 - 2√2 = (√2 - 1)^2 * something? Let's see.\n\n(√2 - 1)^2 = 2 - 2√2 + 1 = 3 - 2√2 — not 4 - 2√2.\n\nTry (√a - √b)^2 = a + b - 2√(ab) = 4 - 2√2\n\nSo a + b = 4, 2√(ab) = 2√2 → √(ab) = √2 → ab = 2\n\nSo a + b = 4, ab = 2\n\nSolve: x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0 → x = [4 ± √(16 - 8)]/2 = [4 ± √8]/2 = [4 ± 2√2]/2 = 2 ± √2\n\nSo √(4 - 2√2) = √(2 + √2) - √(2 - √2)? No, that's not how it works.\n\nActually, √(4 - 2√2) = √(2) * √(2 - √2) — wait, we already have that.\n\nNote that 4 - 2√2 = 2(2 - √2)\n\nSo √(4 - 2√2) = √[2(2 - √2)] = √2 * √(2 - √2)\n\nBut that's what we had in the denominator earlier.\n\nRecall:\n\nHF₀ = 3 (√2 - 1) / √(4 - 2√2) = 3 (√2 - 1) / √[2(2 - √2)] = 3 (√2 - 1) / [√2 * √(2 - √2)]\n\nBut R = 3 / √(2 - √2), so HF₀ = R * (√2 - 1)/√2\n\nAs before.\n\nNow, let's rationalize or simplify (√2 - 1)/√2\n\n= 1 - 1/√2, as before.\n\nPerhaps compute numerically.\n\nR = 3 / √(2 - √2) ≈ 3 / √(2 - 1.4142) = 3 / √0.5858 ≈ 3 / 0.7654 ≈ 3.919\n\nThen HF₀ = R * (1 - 1/√2) ≈ 3.919 * (1 - 0.7071) = 3.919 * 0.2929 ≈ 1.148\n\nBut let's see if we can get an exact value.\n\nHF₀ = 3 (√2 - 1) / √(4 - 2√2)\n\nLet me square it to simplify.\n\nLet S = HF₀ = 3 (√2 - 1) / √(4 - 2√2)\n\nThen S^2 = 9 (2 - 2√2 + 1) / (4 - 2√2) = 9 (3 - 2√2) / (4 - 2√2)\n\nSimplify: numerator 9(3 - 2√2), denominator 2(2 - √2)\n\nSo S^2 = [9(3 - 2√2)] / [2(2 - √2)]\n\nRationalize denominator: multiply numerator and denominator by (2 + √2)\n\nDenominator: 2(2 - √2)(2 + √2) = 2(4 - 2) = 2*2 = 4\n\nNumerator: 9(3 - 2√2)(2 + √2) = 9 [3*2 + 3*√2 - 2√2*2 - 2√2*√2] = 9 [6 + 3√2 - 4√2 - 4] = 9 [2 - √2]\n\nCompute:\n\n(3 - 2√2)(2 + √2) = 3*2 + 3*√2 - 2√2*2 - 2√2*√2 = 6 + 3√2 - 4√2 - 4 = (6-4) + (3-4)√2 = 2 - √2\n\nYes.\n\nSo S^2 = 9 (2 - √2) / 4\n\nThus S = 3 √(2 - √2) / 2\n\nSince S > 0.\n\nSo HF₀ = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}\n\nIs that simplified?\n\nWe can leave it like that, or see if it matches a known value.\n\nRecall that in a regular octagon with side length s, the distance from center to side (apothem) is s/2 * (1 + √2), but here we have a different distance.\n\nBut let's verify with numerical value.\n\n√2 ≈ 1.4142\n\n2 - √2 ≈ 0.5858\n\n√(0.5858) ≈ 0.7654\n\nThen HF₀ = 3/2 * 0.7654 = 1.5 * 0.7654 ≈ 1.148, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nNow, is this the final answer?\n\nBut let's double-check our assumptions.\n\nWe assumed:\n\n- H is the vertex at (R/√2, -R/√2) — which is k=7, 315°.\n\n- Line L1 is x = R, by taking D and F as (R,R) and (R,-R).\n\nIs this consistent with the diagram?\n\nIn the diagram, points D and F are labeled, and also E is the center of the square.\n\nIn our setup, E = (R,0), and D = (R,R), F = (R,-R), so E is on the line DF? No, E is at (R,0), which is on the line x=R, so yes, E is on DF.\n\nBut the problem says \"square centered at E\", and \"line L1 passing through D and F\", which are vertices, and in our case, D and F are opposite vertices, so DF is a diagonal of the square.\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nAlso, H is a vertex of the octagon, and we took it as the bottom-right one.\n\nNow, the perpendicular from H to line x=R is horizontal? No, line x=R is vertical, so perpendicular is horizontal, so foot F₀ has same y-coordinate as H, and x=R.\n\nSo F₀ = (R, -R/√2)\n\nThen distance HF₀ = |R - R/√2| = R|1 - 1/√2| = R(1 - 1/√2), as before.\n\nAnd we have HF₀ = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}\n\nBut let's see if this can be simplified further or if it's the expected form.\n\nPerhaps write it as \\frac{3\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}\n\nNow, is there a better way?\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the square is oriented differently.\n\nSuppose instead that the square has vertices at (0,0), (R,0), (R,R), (0,R), but then center is at (R/2, R/2), and distance from center to (0,0) is √((R/2)^2 + (R/2)^2) = R/√2, but we need it to be R, so not.\n\nOr if we want distance from center to vertex to be R, then for a square with sides parallel to axes, vertices at (±a, ±a), then distance from center (0,0) to (a,a) is a√2 = R, so a = R/√2, vertices at (±R/√2, ±R/√2)\n\nBut then one vertex is at (R/√2, R/√2), not at (0,0).\n\nTo have a vertex at (0,0), we need to shift.\n\nSuppose square with vertices at (0,0), (a,0), (a,a), (0,a), then center at (a/2, a/2), distance to (0,0) is √((a/2)^2 + (a/2)^2) = a/√2 = R, so a = R√2.\n\nThen vertices: (0,0), (R√2,0), (R√2,R√2), (0,R√2)\n\nThen line L1 through D and F — say D=(0,0), F=(R√2,R√2), then line y=x.\n\nThen distance from H to this line.\n\nH is at (R/√2, -R/√2) for the octagon.\n\nDistance from point (x0,y0) to line ax+by+c=0 is |ax0+by0+c|/√(a^2+b^2)\n\nLine y=x, so x - y = 0.\n\nDistance = |x0 - y0| / √2\n\nH = (R/√2, -R/√2), so x0 - y0 = R/√2 - (-R/√2) = 2R/√2 = R√2\n\nDistance = |R√2| / √2 = R\n\nSo HF₀ = R = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nBut earlier we had 1.148, and R≈3.919, which is different.\n\nIn the diagram, if D and F are (0,0) and (R√2,R√2), then line is y=x, and H is at (R/√2, -R/√2) = (R√2/2, -R√2/2), which is on the line y = -x, so distance to y=x is |x0 - y0|/√2 = |R√2/2 - (-R√2/2)| / √2 = |R√2| / √2 = R, as above.\n\nBut in the diagram, it seems that D and F are not on the same diagonal as O1 and the opposite vertex; rather, in the first assumption, with D and F at (R,R) and (R,-R), line x=R, and H at (R/√2, -R/√2), distance R(1 - 1/√2) ≈1.148, which is less than R, and seems more reasonable.\n\nMoreover, in the diagram, the square is likely rotated 45 degrees or something.\n\nBut in our first assumption, with square vertices at (0,0), (R,R), (2R,0), (R,-R), and D and F as (R,R) and (R,-R), line x=R, and H at (R/√2, -R/√2), then HF₀ = R(1 - 1/√2) = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} as we derived.\n\nPerhaps this is the intended answer.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if this matches the side length.\n\nAnother way: in a regular octagon with side length s, the circumradius R = s / (2 sin(π/8)) = s / (2 * sin22.5°)\n\nsin22.5° = √(2 - √2)/2, as before.\n\nSo R = s / [2 * √(2 - √2)/2] = s / √(2 - √2)\n\nWith s=3, R=3/√(2 - √2)\n\nThen HF₀ = R (1 - 1/√2) = [3/√(2 - √2)] * (1 - 1/√2)\n\nAs before.\n\nAnd we simplified to \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}\n\nLet me verify the simplification.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nS = HF₀ = 3 (√2 - 1) / √(4 - 2√2)\n\nS^2 = 9 (3 - 2√2) / (4 - 2√2) = 9 (3 - 2√2) / [2(2 - √2)]\n\nThen multiplied numerator and denominator by (2 + √2):\n\nNumerator: 9 (3 - 2√2)(2 + √2) = 9 [6 + 3√2 - 4√2 - 4] = 9 [2 - √2]\n\nDenominator: 2(2 - √2)(2 + √2) = 2(4 - 2) = 4\n\nSo S^2 = 9(2 - √2)/4\n\nThus S = 3 √(2 - √2) / 2\n\nYes.\n\nSo the length is \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}\n\nNow, is this the final answer?\n\nPerhaps we can write it as \\frac{3\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}\n\nI think this is simplified.\n\nSo, the length of segment HF₀ is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}}\n\nTo box it.\n\nBut let's make sure the units are correct. Side length is 3, answer is approximately 1.148, which is reasonable.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects a numerical answer, but since it's exact, we leave it symbolic.\n\nSo final answer:\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{3\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}}"
