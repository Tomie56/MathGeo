    "We are given a regular octagon centered at O1 with side length 3. A square is inscribed in the octagon’s circumcircle, centered at E, and its vertices lie on that circle. Point H is a vertex of the octagon. Line L1 passes through points D and F. We are to find the perpendicular distance from H to line L1 — that is, the length of segment HF₀, where F₀ is the foot of the perpendicular from H to line L1 (possibly extended).\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Geometry\n\nSince it’s a **regular octagon**, all sides are equal (length 3), and all internal angles are 135°. The vertices lie on a circle (the circumcircle). The square is inscribed in the same circle — meaning its vertices also lie on the circumcircle of the octagon. The square is centered at E — which is likely the same as O1? But the problem says “centered at E”, and O1 is the center of the octagon. So unless E = O1, there’s a discrepancy.\n\nWait — looking at the diagram labels: points D, F, E, O1 are all shown. E is between D and F, and O1 is the center. The square is centered at E — so perhaps E is not O1? But in a regular octagon, if you inscribe a square with vertices on the circumcircle, its center must coincide with the octagon’s center. So likely, **E = O1**.\n\nBut the diagram shows E and O1 as distinct points? Hmm. Let me re-read:\n\n> “A square centered at E is inscribed such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon.”\n\nThis is possible only if E is the center of the circumcircle — i.e., E = O1. So probably, E and O1 are the same point — perhaps a labeling error or redundancy.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is rotated relative to the octagon? But still, for a square inscribed in a circle, its center must be the circle’s center. So E must be O1.\n\nI’ll proceed assuming **E = O1**, the center of the octagon and the circumcircle.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Coordinate Geometry Setup\n\nTo compute distances and perpendiculars, we’ll place the figure on the coordinate plane.\n\nLet’s place the center O1 (which is E) at the origin: **O1 = (0, 0)**.\n\nA regular octagon can be inscribed in a circle of radius R. The side length s of a regular octagon inscribed in a circle of radius R is:\n\n> **s = 2R sin(π/8)**\n\nWe are given s = 3, so:\n\n> 3 = 2R sin(π/8)\n\nWe can solve for R:\n\n> R = 3 / (2 sin(π/8))\n\nWe’ll compute sin(π/8):\n\n> sin(π/8) = sin(22.5°) = √[(1 - cos(45°))/2] = √[(1 - √2/2)/2] = √[(2 - √2)/4] = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo:\n\n> R = 3 / (2 * √(2 - √2)/2) = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nWe can rationalize or leave it for now. Alternatively, compute numerically later if needed.\n\nBut perhaps we can avoid computing R explicitly by using symmetry.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Assign Coordinates to Vertices\n\nLet’s label the octagon vertices in counterclockwise order, starting from the rightmost point (along positive x-axis) as vertex A.\n\nSo:\n\n- Vertex A: angle 0° → (R, 0)\n- Vertex B: angle 45° → (R cos45°, R sin45°)\n- Vertex C: 90° → (0, R)\n- Vertex D: 135° → (-R cos45°, R sin45°)\n- Vertex E: 180° → (-R, 0)\n- Vertex F: 225° → (-R cos45°, -R sin45°)\n- Vertex G: 270° → (0, -R)\n- Vertex H: 315° → (R cos45°, -R sin45°)\n\nWait — but in the diagram, point H is labeled as a vertex, and from the diagram, it appears to be in the lower right — so 315° makes sense.\n\nAlso, point D is at 135°, point F is at 225°, so line L1 is from D to F — which is from 135° to 225°, so it’s a diagonal passing through the center? Let’s check:\n\nD: 135° → (-R/√2, R/√2)\n\nF: 225° → (-R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nSo the line DF goes from (-R/√2, R/√2) to (-R/√2, -R/√2) — that’s a **vertical line** at x = -R/√2.\n\nWait — that’s interesting. So line L1 is **vertical**, at x = -R/√2.\n\nNow, point H is at 315° → (R cos315°, R sin315°) = (R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nWe are to drop a perpendicular from H to line L1 (which is vertical), and find the distance HF₀.\n\nSince L1 is vertical (x = -R/√2), the perpendicular from any point to it is **horizontal** — because perpendicular to vertical is horizontal.\n\nSo the foot F₀ will have the same y-coordinate as H, and x-coordinate equal to that of L1.\n\nSo:\n\n- H: (R/√2, -R/√2)\n- F₀: (-R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nThen, the distance HF₀ is the horizontal distance:\n\n> |x_H - x_{F₀}| = |R/√2 - (-R/√2)| = |2R/√2| = R√2\n\nSo **HF₀ = R√2**\n\nNow recall from earlier:\n\n> R = 3 / (2 sin(π/8)) = 3 / (2 * sin(22.5°))\n\nAnd sin(22.5°) = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo:\n\n> R = 3 / (2 * √(2 - √2)/2) = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nThus:\n\n> HF₀ = R√2 = 3√2 / √(2 - √2)\n\nNow simplify this expression.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Simplify the Expression\n\nWe have:\n\n> HF₀ = 3√2 / √(2 - √2)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √(2 + √2) to rationalize the denominator:\n\nNote: (2 - √2)(2 + √2) = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nSo:\n\n> HF₀ = 3√2 / √(2 - √2) * √(2 + √2)/√(2 + √2) = 3√2 * √(2 + √2) / √[(2 - √2)(2 + √2)] = 3√2 * √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nThe √2 in numerator and denominator cancel:\n\n> HF₀ = 3 * √(2 + √2)\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Final Answer\n\nSo the length of segment HF₀ is:\n\n> **3√(2 + √2)**\n\nWe can leave it in exact form, or compute numerically if needed. But since the problem doesn’t specify, exact form is preferred.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{3\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$"
