    "We are given a geometric construction involving a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3, and a square centered at point E, whose \"radius\" (distance from center to vertex) equals that of the octagon. One vertex of the square is placed at O1. We are to find the radian measure of angle ∠I-O1-K — that is, the angle at O1 between points I and K — using **vector dot product methods**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the structure\n\nWe are told:\n\n- Regular octagon centered at O1, side length = 3.\n- Square centered at E, same \"radius\" as octagon (i.e., distance from center to vertex is same as for octagon).\n- One vertex of the square is at O1.\n- We need angle ∠I-O1-K, formed by segments O1I and O1K.\n\nFrom the diagram (though we don’t have the image, we infer from labels and standard construction):\n\n- The octagon has 8 vertices. Since it’s regular and centered at O1, we can assign coordinates to its vertices using polar coordinates with angle increments of π/4 (since 2π/8 = π/4).\n- The square centered at E has one vertex at O1. Since it’s a square, its vertices are spaced 90° (π/2 radians) apart.\n- Points I and K are vertices of the square (since they are connected to O1, and O1 is a vertex of the square). So I and K are two other vertices of the square, and we are to find the angle at O1 between them.\n\nWait — but O1 is a **vertex** of the square, not the center. The center of the square is E. So the square has vertices: O1, I, ?, K (probably in order). Since it’s a square, the angle at vertex O1 between adjacent vertices I and K should be 90°, but that would be if I and K are adjacent to O1. But in a square, each vertex has two adjacent vertices, and the angle between them is 90°. But the problem says “angle ∠I-O1-K”, which implies I and K are two points connected to O1, so likely I and K are the two neighbors of O1 on the square.\n\nBut if that’s the case, then ∠I-O1-K is the internal angle of the square at vertex O1, which is **π/2 radians**.\n\nBut the problem says to use **vector dot product methods**, implying that it’s not trivial or that we need to verify via coordinates.\n\nMoreover, the square is centered at E, and O1 is one of its vertices. So we need to figure out the positions of I and K relative to O1.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Assign coordinates\n\nLet’s place the figure on the coordinate plane to compute vectors.\n\nLet’s assume:\n\n- The regular octagon is centered at O1 = (0, 0).\n- The square is centered at E, and has O1 as one of its vertices. Since the square has the same “radius” as the octagon, we need to compute the distance from center to vertex for the octagon.\n\n### Compute radius R of the regular octagon\n\nFor a regular octagon with side length s, the radius (distance from center to vertex) is:\n\n> R = s / (2 sin(π/8))\n\nBecause in a regular polygon, the radius R relates to side length s by:\n\n> s = 2 R sin(π/n)\n\nFor n=8:\n\n> s = 2 R sin(π/8) → R = s / (2 sin(π/8))\n\nGiven s = 3:\n\n> R = 3 / (2 sin(π/8))\n\nWe’ll keep it symbolic for now.\n\nBut we may not need the actual value if we’re computing angles via vectors — because angles depend on direction, not magnitude.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Determine positions of I and K\n\nSince the square is centered at E, and O1 is one of its vertices, and the square has the same “radius” (distance from center to vertex) as the octagon, then the distance from E to O1 is R.\n\nMoreover, since it’s a square, the center E is equidistant to all four vertices, and the vertices are at 90° intervals around E.\n\nSo if O1 is one vertex of the square, then the other vertices are obtained by rotating O1 around E by 90°, 180°, 270°.\n\nBut we don’t know where E is yet.\n\nWait — the square is centered at E, and O1 is a vertex. So vector from E to O1 has length R, and direction, say, θ.\n\nThen the other vertices are at angles θ + π/2, θ + π, θ + 3π/2 from E.\n\nBut we need to find vectors O1I and O1K — that is, vectors from O1 to I and from O1 to K.\n\nLet’s assign coordinates.\n\nLet’s place O1 at (0, 0) for simplicity — but wait, O1 is the center of the octagon, and also a vertex of the square. So if we place O1 at (0,0), then the center of the square E is at some point such that distance from E to O1 is R.\n\nLet’s assume that the square is oriented such that from center E, O1 is at angle 0° — i.e., along the positive x-axis.\n\nSo let’s define:\n\n- Let E be at (R, 0) — then O1 is at (0,0), because distance from E to O1 is R.\n\nWait, distance from E to O1 is R, so if E is at (R, 0), then O1 is at (0,0), yes.\n\nNow, the square has center at E = (R, 0), and vertices at distance R from E, at angles 0°, 90°, 180°, 270°.\n\nSo:\n\n- Vertex 1: angle 0° → (R + R cos(0), 0 + R sin(0)) = (R + R, 0) = (2R, 0) — but that’s not O1.\n\nWait — no. If center is at E = (R, 0), and a vertex is at O1 = (0,0), then the vector from E to O1 is (-R, 0), so the direction is 180°.\n\nSo the four vertices of the square are at angles 180°, 270°, 0°, 90° from center E.\n\nSo:\n\n- Vertex at 180°: E + R*(cos(180°), sin(180°)) = (R, 0) + R*(-1, 0) = (0, 0) → O1 ✓\n- Vertex at 270°: E + R*(cos(270°), sin(270°)) = (R, 0) + R*(0, -1) = (R, -R) → let’s call this point I\n- Vertex at 0°: E + R*(cos(0°), sin(0°)) = (R, 0) + R*(1, 0) = (2R, 0) → call this point J or something\n- Vertex at 90°: E + R*(cos(90°), sin(90°)) = (R, 0) + R*(0, 1) = (R, R) → call this point K\n\nSo:\n\n- O1 = (0, 0)\n- I = (R, -R)\n- K = (R, R)\n\nNow, we need vectors:\n\n- Vector O1I = I - O1 = (R, -R) - (0,0) = (R, -R)\n- Vector O1K = K - O1 = (R, R) - (0,0) = (R, R)\n\nNow, angle between vectors O1I and O1K is ∠I-O1-K.\n\nUse dot product formula:\n\n> **u · v = |u| |v| cosθ**\n\nSo:\n\nu = (R, -R), v = (R, R)\n\nDot product u·v = R*R + (-R)*R = R² - R² = 0\n\nSo cosθ = 0 → θ = π/2 radians.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe angle ∠I-O1-K is π/2 radians.\n\nThis makes sense geometrically: since I and K are adjacent vertices of the square (relative to O1), and in a square, the internal angle is 90°, or π/2 radians.\n\nThe dot product confirms it: the vectors are perpendicular.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}}$"
