    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric circles and a triangle circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices on the larger circle. We are to find the length of segment FM₀, where F is the point of tangency on AC, and M₀ is the midpoint of AC.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup\n\n- Smaller circle: center O1, radius = 5.\n- Larger circle: same center O1, radius = 10 (scaled by factor 2).\n- Triangle ABC is circumscribed about the smaller circle → the smaller circle is the **incircle** of triangle ABC.\n- Vertices A, B, C lie on the larger circle → triangle ABC is **inscribed** in the larger circle.\n- So, triangle ABC has:\n  - **Incircle** centered at O1 with radius 5.\n  - **Circumcircle** centered at O1 with radius 10.\n\nThis is a very special triangle: it is both **inscribed** in a circle of radius 10 and **circumscribed** about a circle of radius 5, both centered at the same point O1.\n\nThis implies that the triangle is **equilateral**.\n\n---\n\n### Why must triangle ABC be equilateral?\n\nIn general, for a triangle to have its **incenter** and **circumcenter** coincide, it must be **equilateral**.\n\n- Incenter = center of incircle = point where angle bisectors meet.\n- Circumcenter = center of circumcircle = point where perpendicular bisectors meet.\n- These two centers coincide **only** in an equilateral triangle.\n\nTherefore, triangle ABC is **equilateral**, with:\n\n- Inradius r = 5\n- Circumradius R = 10\n\nThis matches the known relation for an equilateral triangle:\n\n> In an equilateral triangle, the circumradius R and inradius r are related by:\n> \n> $$\nR = 2r\n$$\n\nIndeed, 10 = 2 × 5 → this checks out.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use properties of equilateral triangle\n\nLet’s denote the side length of equilateral triangle ABC as $ s $.\n\nWe know the formulas for inradius and circumradius of an equilateral triangle:\n\n- Inradius: $ r = \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}} $\n- Circumradius: $ R = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} $\n\nWe are given $ r = 5 $, so:\n\n$$\n5 = \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}} \\Rightarrow s = 10\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nCheck with circumradius:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = 10 \\quad \\text{✓}\n$$\n\nSo side length $ s = 10\\sqrt{3} $\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Coordinates setup (for calculation)\n\nTo compute the length FM₀, we can place the triangle in coordinate plane with center O1 at origin (0,0).\n\nIn an equilateral triangle centered at origin, we can place the vertices as follows:\n\nLet’s place vertex A at (R, 0) = (10, 0)\n\nSince it’s equilateral, the other vertices are at 120° and 240°:\n\n- A: $ (10, 0) $\n- B: $ (10 \\cos 120°, 10 \\sin 120°) = (10 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}), 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}) = (-5, 5\\sqrt{3}) $\n- C: $ (10 \\cos 240°, 10 \\sin 240°) = (10 \\cdot (-\\frac{1}{2}), 10 \\cdot (-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2})) = (-5, -5\\sqrt{3}) $\n\nSo:\n\n- A = (10, 0)\n- B = (-5, 5√3)\n- C = (-5, -5√3)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find point F — point of tangency on AC\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides are located at the **midpoints** of the sides.\n\nWhy? Because the incircle touches each side at a point equidistant from the two adjacent vertices — and in an equilateral triangle, the incenter is also the centroid, and the tangency points lie at the midpoints.\n\nSo, F is the midpoint of AC.\n\nWait — but M₀ is also defined as the midpoint of AC.\n\nSo F and M₀ are the same point?\n\nThat can’t be — the problem says:\n\n> Points D, E, and F are the points of tangency of the triangle with the smaller circle, where D lies on AB, E on BC, and F on AC. Point M₀ is the midpoint of segment AC (line L7). A line segment is drawn connecting point F to point M₀.\n\nIf F is the midpoint of AC, then F = M₀, so FM₀ = 0.\n\nBut that seems too trivial — and likely incorrect.\n\nWait — is F really the midpoint?\n\nLet’s double-check.\n\nIn any triangle, the point where the incircle touches a side is located at a distance from the vertices equal to the **tangent lengths**.\n\nIn triangle ABC, let’s denote:\n\n- Let the tangent lengths be:\n  - From A: x\n  - From B: y\n  - From C: z\n\nThen:\n\n- AB = x + y\n- BC = y + z\n- AC = x + z\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal, so:\n\nx + y = y + z = x + z → implies x = y = z\n\nSo each tangent length is equal → the point of tangency on each side is at distance x from each vertex.\n\nSince side length s = 10√3, and x + x = s → 2x = s → x = s/2 = 5√3\n\nWait — that would mean the point of tangency is at distance 5√3 from each vertex along the side — which is exactly the **midpoint**.\n\nYes! So in an equilateral triangle, the incircle touches each side at its **midpoint**.\n\nTherefore, F is the midpoint of AC → F = M₀.\n\nThus, segment FM₀ has length 0.\n\nBut that seems like a trick question. Is that possible?\n\nWait — let’s check with coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute coordinates of F and M₀\n\nWe have:\n\n- A = (10, 0)\n- C = (-5, -5√3)\n\nMidpoint M₀ of AC:\n\n$$\nM_0 = \\left( \\frac{10 + (-5)}{2}, \\frac{0 + (-5\\sqrt{3})}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, since the incircle touches AC at its midpoint (as established), then F = M₀.\n\nTherefore, distance FM₀ = 0.\n\n---\n\n### But wait — the problem says \"a line segment is drawn connecting point F to point M₀\" — implying they are distinct.\n\nIs there a mistake in our reasoning?\n\nLet’s reconsider.\n\nIn a general triangle, the point of tangency of the incircle with a side is **not** the midpoint — unless the triangle is isosceles with respect to that side.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, since all sides are equal and symmetric, the incircle touches each side at its midpoint — this is correct.\n\nBut perhaps the triangle is **not** equilateral?\n\nWait — we assumed it must be equilateral because incenter and circumcenter coincide.\n\nBut is that necessarily true here?\n\nLet me re-express:\n\nWe are told:\n\n- The incircle is centered at O1, radius 5.\n- The circumcircle is centered at O1, radius 10.\n- So the incenter and circumcenter are the same point.\n\nIn any triangle, if incenter and circumcenter coincide, then the triangle is equilateral.\n\nThis is a **standard theorem**.\n\n> **Theorem**: In a triangle, the incenter and circumcenter coincide if and only if the triangle is equilateral.\n\nTherefore, our conclusion is correct: triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nHence, F = M₀ → FM₀ = 0.\n\nBut perhaps the problem intends for us to consider that the triangle is **not** equilateral? Maybe the scaling is misinterpreted?\n\nWait — let’s reread the problem:\n\n> \"a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle.\"\n\nSo: incircle radius 5, circumcircle radius 10, same center → triangle must be equilateral.\n\nSo F is midpoint of AC → M₀ is midpoint of AC → F = M₀ → FM₀ = 0.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a typo? Or perhaps I misread?\n\nWait — let’s check the diagram description.\n\nThe diagram shows:\n\n- Points A, B, C on the large circle.\n- Smaller circle inside, tangent to AB, BC, AC at D, E, F.\n- M₀ is midpoint of AC.\n- Segment from F to M₀.\n\nIn the diagram, F and M₀ might be distinct — but according to geometry, they should coincide.\n\nUnless... the triangle is **not** equilateral?\n\nBut how can incenter and circumcenter coincide without the triangle being equilateral?\n\nActually, they can’t. It’s a known result.\n\nPerhaps the scaling is not of the incircle to circumcircle, but something else?\n\nWait — the problem says:\n\n> \"a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10.\"\n\nThen: \"A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle.\"\n\nSo the smaller circle is the incircle, larger is circumcircle.\n\nSo yes, same center, r=5, R=10 → equilateral.\n\nPerhaps the point F is not the point of tangency on AC? But the problem says it is.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe \"scaled concentrically\" means something else? Like the triangle is scaled? But no, it says the circle is scaled.\n\nPerhaps the triangle is not inscribed in the larger circle in the usual sense? But it says \"vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle\".\n\nI think our reasoning is correct.\n\nBut let’s suppose, for the sake of argument, that the triangle is not equilateral — is there a triangle with inradius 5, circumradius 10, and same center?\n\nLet’s use the formula relating R, r, and distance d between incenter and circumcenter:\n\n> $ d^2 = R(R - 2r) $\n\nIf d = 0 (same center), then:\n\n$$\n0 = R(R - 2r) \\Rightarrow R = 2r\n$$\n\nWhich is satisfied here: R=10, r=5.\n\nAnd this equation holds **only** when the triangle is equilateral.\n\nIn fact, this formula is derived from Euler’s formula, and equality d=0 occurs only for equilateral triangles.\n\nSo, again, triangle must be equilateral.\n\nTherefore, F = M₀ → FM₀ = 0.\n\nPerhaps the problem is testing this insight?\n\nOr maybe there's a misinterpretation of \"point of tangency\".\n\nLet’s try to compute coordinates of F assuming it's the point of tangency, and see if it coincides with M₀.\n\nIn coordinate geometry, for a triangle with vertices A, B, C, the point of tangency on side AC can be found using the formula:\n\nThe distance from A to the point of tangency on AC is $ s - b $, where s is semiperimeter, b is length of side opposite B.\n\nIn our case, since it's equilateral, s = (3 * 10√3)/2 = 15√3\n\nLength of side opposite B is AC = 10√3\n\nSo distance from A to F = s - b = 15√3 - 10√3 = 5√3\n\nLength of AC = 10√3, so from A, move 5√3 along AC to reach F — which is the midpoint.\n\nYes, so F is midpoint.\n\nTherefore, FM₀ = 0.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{0}\n$$\n\nThis is the correct mathematical answer based on the given conditions. The problem may be designed to test the understanding that in an equilateral triangle, the incenter coincides with the circumcenter, and the points of tangency are the midpoints of the sides."
