    "We are given a large circle centered at O1 with radius 10, circumscribing an equilateral triangle ABC. A smaller concentric circle (same center O1) with radius 5 is inscribed in triangle ABC, tangent to its sides at D (on AB), E (on BC), and F (on AC). We are to find the length of segment DE.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry\n\n- Triangle ABC is equilateral.\n- The large circle is the **circumcircle** of triangle ABC → radius R = 10.\n- The small circle is the **incircle** of triangle ABC → radius r = 5.\n- The center O1 is the **centroid**, **incenter**, and **circumcenter** of the equilateral triangle (all coincide).\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the relationship between the circumradius R and inradius r is:\n\n> **r = R / 2**\n\nIndeed, here R = 10, r = 5 → this checks out. So the triangle is consistent.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Coordinates Setup (Optional but helpful)\n\nLet’s place the triangle in the coordinate plane for clarity.\n\nPlace the center O1 at the origin (0, 0).\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the vertices can be placed at:\n\n- A: (R, 0) = (10, 0)\n- B: (R·cos(120°), R·sin(120°)) = (10·(-1/2), 10·(√3/2)) = (-5, 5√3)\n- C: (R·cos(240°), R·sin(240°)) = (10·(-1/2), 10·(-√3/2)) = (-5, -5√3)\n\nLet’s verify: distance from O1 to each vertex is 10 → good.\n\nNow, the incircle touches the sides at D, E, F.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides are located at the **midpoints** of the sides. Why?\n\nBecause in an equilateral triangle, the incenter coincides with the centroid, and the perpendicular from the center to each side hits the midpoint (due to symmetry).\n\nSo:\n\n- D is midpoint of AB\n- E is midpoint of BC\n- F is midpoint of AC\n\nLet’s compute coordinates of D and E.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute Coordinates of D and E\n\n**Point A: (10, 0)**  \n**Point B: (-5, 5√3)**\n\nMidpoint D of AB:\n\n> D_x = (10 + (-5)) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5  \n> D_y = (0 + 5√3) / 2 = (5√3)/2\n\nSo D = (2.5, (5√3)/2)\n\n**Point B: (-5, 5√3)**  \n**Point C: (-5, -5√3)**\n\nMidpoint E of BC:\n\n> E_x = (-5 + (-5)) / 2 = -5  \n> E_y = (5√3 + (-5√3)) / 2 = 0\n\nSo E = (-5, 0)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute Distance DE\n\nUse distance formula:\n\n> DE = √[(x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)²]\n\nPlug in D = (2.5, (5√3)/2), E = (-5, 0)\n\nΔx = -5 - 2.5 = -7.5  \nΔy = 0 - (5√3)/2 = - (5√3)/2\n\nSo:\n\nDE² = (-7.5)² + [-(5√3)/2]²  \n= 56.25 + (25 * 3) / 4  \n= 56.25 + 75 / 4  \n= 56.25 + 18.75  \n= 75\n\nTherefore,\n\n> DE = √75 = √(25 * 3) = 5√3\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nThis is the length of segment DE."
