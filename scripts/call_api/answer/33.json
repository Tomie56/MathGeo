    "We are given a regular hexagon with center O₁ and side length 5. A smaller, concentric hexagon (scaled by 1/2) is inscribed inside it — but we are not directly using the inner hexagon for the calculation. We are to find the length of segment M₀M₁, where:\n\n- M₀ is the midpoint of side AB of the **outer** hexagon.\n- M₁ is the midpoint of side FA of the **outer** hexagon.\n\nNote: The problem mentions a rotation by π/6 radians, but since the hexagon is regular and we’re dealing with midpoints of sides, and the figure is symmetric, the rotation does not affect the relative positions of the midpoints — it’s just a red herring or perhaps meant to orient the hexagon. Since no specific orientation is given, we can assume a standard position for simplicity.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Place the hexagon on the coordinate plane\n\nLet’s place the regular hexagon with center O₁ at the origin (0,0), and orient it so that point A is at (5, 0). Since it’s a regular hexagon, we can label the vertices in counterclockwise order as A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nIn a regular hexagon, each vertex is separated by 60° (π/3 radians) from the next.\n\nSo, the coordinates of the vertices can be found using:\n\n> **Vertex k**: (r * cos(θ_k), r * sin(θ_k)), where r = 5, and θ_k = k * π/3 for k = 0 to 5.\n\nLet’s assign:\n\n- A: k=0 → θ = 0 → (5, 0)\n- B: k=1 → θ = π/3 → (5 cos(π/3), 5 sin(π/3)) = (5*(1/2), 5*(√3/2)) = (2.5, (5√3)/2)\n- C: k=2 → θ = 2π/3 → (5 cos(2π/3), 5 sin(2π/3)) = (5*(-1/2), 5*(√3/2)) = (-2.5, (5√3)/2)\n- D: k=3 → θ = π → (-5, 0)\n- E: k=4 → θ = 4π/3 → (5 cos(4π/3), 5 sin(4π/3)) = (5*(-1/2), 5*(-√3/2)) = (-2.5, -(5√3)/2)\n- F: k=5 → θ = 5π/3 → (5 cos(5π/3), 5 sin(5π/3)) = (5*(1/2), 5*(-√3/2)) = (2.5, -(5√3)/2)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find coordinates of M₀ and M₁\n\nM₀ is the midpoint of side AB.\n\nA = (5, 0), B = (2.5, (5√3)/2)\n\nMidpoint M₀ = average of coordinates:\n\n> M₀_x = (5 + 2.5)/2 = 7.5/2 = 3.75  \n> M₀_y = (0 + (5√3)/2)/2 = (5√3)/4\n\nSo, M₀ = (3.75, (5√3)/4)\n\nM₁ is the midpoint of side FA.\n\nF = (2.5, -(5√3)/2), A = (5, 0)\n\nMidpoint M₁ = average:\n\n> M₁_x = (2.5 + 5)/2 = 7.5/2 = 3.75  \n> M₁_y = (-(5√3)/2 + 0)/2 = -(5√3)/4\n\nSo, M₁ = (3.75, -(5√3)/4)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute distance between M₀ and M₁\n\nBoth points have the same x-coordinate: 3.75\n\nSo, the distance is just the absolute difference in y-coordinates:\n\n> |M₀_y - M₁_y| = |(5√3)/4 - (-(5√3)/4)| = |(5√3)/4 + (5√3)/4| = |(10√3)/4| = (10√3)/4 = (5√3)/2\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Note on the rotation and inner hexagon:\n\nThe problem mentions a rotation by π/6 and a scaled-down hexagon. However, since we are only using midpoints of sides of the **outer** hexagon, and the rotation does not change distances (it’s a rigid transformation), and the inner hexagon is not involved in the definition of M₀ or M₁, those details are irrelevant for this particular question.\n\nSo, we can safely ignore them.\n\n✅ Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\dfrac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}}$"
