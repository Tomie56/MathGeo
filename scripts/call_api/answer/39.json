  "answer": [
    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two concentric regular hexagons:\n\n- **Outer hexagon**: regular, centered at O1, side length = 5.\n- **Inner hexagon**: concentric, scaled-down by factor 1/2 (so side length = 2.5), and **rotated by π/6 radians** (i.e., 30 degrees) relative to the outer one.\n- There are 13 total points identified: vertices of both hexagons and their intersections.\n- We are to find the length of segment **FD**, where F and D are points **on the sides of the outer hexagon**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the setup\n\nLet’s first fix a coordinate system.\n\nPlace the center O1 at the origin (0,0).\n\nLet’s assume the **outer hexagon** is oriented with one vertex on the positive x-axis. So, its vertices can be labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in counterclockwise order, starting from (5, 0).\n\nThe coordinates of the vertices of a regular hexagon with center at origin and side length s, with one vertex at (s, 0), are:\n\nFor k = 0 to 5:\n\n> x_k = s * cos(2πk/6) = s * cos(πk/3)  \n> y_k = s * sin(2πk/6) = s * sin(πk/3)\n\nSo for s = 5:\n\n- A: k=0 → (5, 0)\n- B: k=1 → (5 cos(π/3), 5 sin(π/3)) = (2.5, (5√3)/2)\n- C: k=2 → (5 cos(2π/3), 5 sin(2π/3)) = (-2.5, (5√3)/2)\n- D: k=3 → (5 cos(π), 5 sin(π)) = (-5, 0)\n- E: k=4 → (5 cos(4π/3), 5 sin(4π/3)) = (-2.5, -(5√3)/2)\n- F: k=5 → (5 cos(5π/3), 5 sin(5π/3)) = (2.5, -(5√3)/2)\n\nSo:\n\n- **F = (2.5, - (5√3)/2)**\n- **D = (-5, 0)**\n\nWait — but the problem says: “a line segment is drawn connecting point F and point D, both lying on the sides of the outer hexagon.”\n\nIn our labeling, F and D are **vertices** of the outer hexagon, not just “on the sides”. But perhaps the labeling in the diagram is different? Let’s check the diagram description.\n\nLooking at the diagram description:\n\n- Points labeled A, B, C, D, E, F are the outer hexagon vertices.\n- Points G, H, I, J, K, L are the inner hexagon vertices (but only 6 are shown — H, G, L, K, J, I — so likely G to L are the inner ones).\n- O1 is the center.\n- The inner hexagon is rotated by π/6, so its vertices are rotated 30° relative to the outer.\n\nBut the problem says: “After this derivation, 13 total points are identified, including vertices and intersections.” So perhaps F and D are **not** vertices, but **intersection points** of the inner hexagon with the outer hexagon’s sides?\n\nWait — that’s critical.\n\nThe problem says: “both lying on the sides of the outer hexagon.” So F and D are **not necessarily vertices** — they are points **on the sides** of the outer hexagon. And from the diagram labeling, they are labeled F and D — which in the outer hexagon are vertices — but perhaps in this context, they are different points?\n\nWait — let’s read again:\n\n> “In the final configuration, a line segment is drawn connecting point F and point D, both lying on the sides of the outer hexagon.”\n\nSo even if in the diagram they are labeled at vertices, the problem clarifies they lie **on the sides** — so perhaps they are **intersection points** between the inner rotated hexagon and the outer hexagon’s sides.\n\nThat makes sense — because when you inscribe a rotated hexagon inside another, their sides intersect, and those intersection points are additional points (besides the 6+6=12 vertices), making 13 total points (so one intersection point is counted twice? Or perhaps one vertex coincides? But unlikely).\n\nActually, two regular hexagons, concentric, one rotated by 30°, will have each side of the inner hexagon intersecting two sides of the outer hexagon? Let’s think.\n\nBut perhaps we can avoid overcomplicating.\n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n> “A regular hexagon centered at point O1 with side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. After this derivation, 13 total points are identified, including vertices and intersections.”\n\nWait — it says the **outer hexagon** is rotated by π/6? Or the inner one?\n\nThe phrasing: “A regular hexagon ... is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon ... is inscribed within it”\n\nIt’s ambiguous. But logically, if the outer one is rotated, and the inner one is inscribed, it’s more likely that the **inner one is rotated** relative to the outer one.\n\nBut the sentence says: “A regular hexagon ... is rotated by π/6 radians.” — that’s the first one mentioned — the outer one? Then the inner one is inscribed within it — but if the outer one is rotated, and the inner one is scaled-down and concentric, it might not be rotated — but the problem says “after this derivation”, implying the rotation is applied to the inner one.\n\nActually, let’s parse:\n\n> “A regular hexagon centered at point O1 with side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1.”\n\nThis is poorly phrased. It could mean:\n\n- The outer hexagon is rotated by π/6.\n- Then a scaled-down hexagon is inscribed — but if it’s inscribed and concentric, it might be aligned or rotated.\n\nBut then it says “after this derivation, 13 total points are identified, including vertices and intersections” — so likely, the inner hexagon is rotated relative to the outer one, causing intersections.\n\nIn standard problems, when you have two concentric regular hexagons, one rotated by 30°, and scaled, their sides intersect, and you get additional points.\n\nMoreover, in a regular hexagon, rotating by 30° (π/6) aligns the vertices of the inner hexagon with the midpoints of the outer hexagon’s sides — but only if the scale factor is appropriate.\n\nWait — let’s calculate.\n\nIn a regular hexagon, the distance from center to vertex is equal to the side length. The distance from center to the middle of a side (apothem) is (s√3)/2.\n\nFor outer hexagon, side = 5, so apothem = (5√3)/2 ≈ 4.33.\n\nIf we inscribe a smaller hexagon, scaled by 1/2, its “radius” (distance from center to vertex) is 2.5.\n\nBut 2.5 < 4.33, so it fits inside.\n\nIf we rotate the inner hexagon by 30°, then its vertices will lie along the lines from center to the midpoints of the outer hexagon’s sides.\n\nBecause in a regular hexagon, rotating by 30° maps vertices to midpoints of sides.\n\nSo, if the inner hexagon is rotated by 30°, its vertices will lie on the apothems of the outer hexagon — i.e., on the lines from center to midpoints of outer sides.\n\nBut the problem says “inscribed within it” — which might mean that the inner hexagon is entirely within the outer, and perhaps its vertices touch the sides of the outer hexagon.\n\nIf the inner hexagon has side length 2.5, and is rotated by 30°, then its vertices are at distance 2.5 from center, along directions 30°, 90°, 150°, etc.\n\nThe outer hexagon has sides that are perpendicular to the apothems — the apothems are at 0°, 60°, 120°, etc. — wait no.\n\nLet’s be precise.\n\nFor outer hexagon, vertices at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°.\n\nThe sides are between these vertices. The midpoint of a side is at the average angle, so for side between 0° and 60°, midpoint at 30°, and the apothem is in that direction.\n\nSo the direction to the midpoint of side AB (between A at 0° and B at 60°) is 30°.\n\nSimilarly, midpoint of BC is at 90°, etc.\n\nSo if the inner hexagon is rotated by 30°, its vertices are at 30°, 90°, 150°, 210°, 270°, 330° — which are exactly the directions to the midpoints of the outer hexagon’s sides.\n\nAnd since the inner hexagon has “radius” 2.5, and the apothem of the outer is (5√3)/2 ≈ 4.33, which is greater than 2.5, so the inner hexagon’s vertices are inside the outer hexagon, not on its sides.\n\nBut the problem says “inscribed within it” — which might mean that the inner hexagon is scaled so that its vertices lie on the sides of the outer hexagon.\n\nIn that case, for the inner hexagon’s vertex to lie on the outer hexagon’s side, we need the distance from center to that vertex to be equal to the distance from center to the side — i.e., the apothem.\n\nFor outer hexagon, apothem = (s√3)/2 = (5√3)/2.\n\nSo if the inner hexagon is scaled so that its \"radius\" (distance from center to vertex) is (5√3)/2, then its side length would be (5√3)/2, since in a regular hexagon, radius = side length.\n\nBut the problem says scale factor 1/2, so side length 2.5, radius 2.5.\n\n2.5 vs (5√3)/2 ≈ 4.33 — not equal.\n\nSo the inner hexagon’s vertices do not lie on the outer hexagon’s sides.\n\nTherefore, the 13 points must include:\n\n- 6 vertices of outer hexagon\n- 6 vertices of inner hexagon\n- 1 intersection point? But that doesn't make sense — likely, each side of the inner hexagon intersects two sides of the outer hexagon, but since they are both convex and concentric, and one is rotated, each side of the inner hexagon may intersect two sides of the outer hexagon, but in a hexagon, with 6 sides, that could give up to 12 intersection points, but many may not intersect or may be at vertices.\n\nActually, for two concentric regular hexagons, one rotated by 30°, and scaled by 1/2, let's calculate if their sides intersect.\n\nPerhaps it's easier to assume that \"F\" and \"D\" are the vertices of the outer hexagon, as labeled in the diagram, and the problem is simply asking for the distance between vertices F and D of the outer hexagon.\n\nIn our earlier calculation:\n\n- F = (2.5, - (5√3)/2)\n- D = (-5, 0)\n\nThen distance FD = sqrt[ (2.5 - (-5))^2 + ( - (5√3)/2 - 0 )^2 ] = sqrt[ (7.5)^2 + ( - (5√3)/2 )^2 ]\n\nCalculate:\n\n7.5^2 = 56.25\n\n(5√3/2)^2 = 25 * 3 / 4 = 75/4 = 18.75\n\nSum = 56.25 + 18.75 = 75\n\nSo FD = sqrt(75) = 5√3\n\nIs that possible? In a regular hexagon, the distance between two vertices separated by two vertices (like F to D: F to E to D, so two steps) should be s * √3, where s is side length.\n\nIn a regular hexagon, distance between adjacent vertices is s.\n\nDistance between vertices two apart (separated by one vertex) is s * √3.\n\nDistance between opposite vertices is 2s.\n\nIn our case, from F to D: let's see the labeling.\n\nIf A,B,C,D,E,F in order, then from F to D: F to A to B to C to D? No, that's not right.\n\nVertices in order: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nSo from F to D: F to E to D — that's two steps, so separated by one vertex (E).\n\nSo yes, distance should be s * √3 = 5√3.\n\nAnd we calculated sqrt(75) = 5√3, yes.\n\nBut the problem says \"both lying on the sides of the outer hexagon\" — and if F and D are vertices, they are on the sides, since vertices are endpoints of sides.\n\nSo perhaps it's that simple.\n\nBut why mention the inner hexagon and the 13 points? Maybe to distract, or perhaps in the diagram, F and D are not vertices, but intersection points.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, the points are labeled differently.\n\nLooking back at the diagram description:\n\n> \"A regular hexagon centered at point O1 with side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. After this derivation, 13 total points are identified, including vertices and intersections. In the final configuration, a line segment is drawn connecting point F and point D, both lying on the sides of the outer hexagon.\"\n\nAnd the diagram has points A,B,C,D,E,F for outer, G,H,I,J,K,L for inner, and O1.\n\nIn the diagram, F and D are likely vertices of the outer hexagon, as per standard labeling.\n\nMoreover, in the coordinate system I set, D is at (-5,0), F is at (2.5, -5√3/2), and distance is 5√3.\n\nPerhaps the rotation is applied to the outer hexagon, but that doesn't change distances.\n\nOr perhaps the inner hexagon's rotation affects the labeling, but the problem says F and D are on the outer hexagon's sides, so likely vertices.\n\nPerhaps \"F\" and \"D\" refer to intersection points.\n\nLet's assume that the inner hexagon is rotated by 30°, and scaled by 1/2, and we need to find where its sides intersect the outer hexagon's sides, and then F and D are two such intersection points.\n\nBut which ones? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, F and D are specific points.\n\nSince the diagram is not visible, and the problem is from a source that might expect the simple answer, and given that 5√3 is a nice number, and matches the distance between vertices two apart in a regular hexagon, I think that's the intended answer.\n\nMoreover, the 13 points might be a red herring, or perhaps for a different part of the problem.\n\nPerhaps \"F\" and \"D\" are not the vertices, but the points where the inner hexagon intersects the outer hexagon's sides.\n\nLet's try to calculate that.\n\nAssume outer hexagon with vertices at:\n\nA: (5, 0)\nB: (2.5, (5√3)/2)\nC: (-2.5, (5√3)/2)\nD: (-5, 0)\nE: (-2.5, -(5√3)/2)\nF: (2.5, -(5√3)/2)\n\nInner hexagon: scaled by 1/2, so \"radius\" 2.5, and rotated by 30°.\n\nSo its vertices are at angles 30°, 90°, 150°, 210°, 270°, 330°.\n\nSo coordinates:\n\nG: 30°: (2.5 cos30°, 2.5 sin30°) = (2.5 * √3/2, 2.5 * 1/2) = (2.5√3/2, 1.25)\n\nH: 90°: (0, 2.5)\n\nI: 150°: (2.5 cos150°, 2.5 sin150°) = (2.5 * (-√3/2), 2.5 * 1/2) = (-2.5√3/2, 1.25)\n\nJ: 210°: (2.5 cos210°, 2.5 sin210°) = (2.5 * (-√3/2), 2.5 * (-1/2)) = (-2.5√3/2, -1.25)\n\nK: 270°: (0, -2.5)\n\nL: 330°: (2.5 cos330°, 2.5 sin330°) = (2.5 * √3/2, 2.5 * (-1/2)) = (2.5√3/2, -1.25)\n\nNow, the inner hexagon's sides are between these points.\n\nThe outer hexagon's sides are between its vertices.\n\nWe need to find where the inner hexagon's sides intersect the outer hexagon's sides.\n\nFor example, consider side of inner hexagon from G to H: from (2.5√3/2, 1.25) to (0, 2.5)\n\nThis side may intersect with outer hexagon's side from A to B or from B to C, etc.\n\nLet's find intersection with outer side AB.\n\nOuter side AB: from A(5,0) to B(2.5, 5√3/2)\n\nParametrize AB.\n\nLet t from 0 to 1:\n\nx = 5 + t*(2.5 - 5) = 5 - 2.5t\n\ny = 0 + t*(5√3/2 - 0) = (5√3/2) t\n\nInner side GH: from G(2.5√3/2, 1.25) to H(0, 2.5)\n\nParametrize with s from 0 to 1:\n\nx = 2.5√3/2 + s*(0 - 2.5√3/2) = 2.5√3/2 (1 - s)\n\ny = 1.25 + s*(2.5 - 1.25) = 1.25 + 1.25s\n\nSet equal:\n\n5 - 2.5t = 2.5√3/2 (1 - s)  ...(1)\n\n(5√3/2) t = 1.25 + 1.25s  ...(2)\n\nSimplify.\n\nFrom (2): (5√3/2) t = 1.25(1 + s)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.25: (5√3/2)/1.25 t = 1 + s\n\n5√3/2 divided by 5/4 = (5√3/2)*(4/5) = 2√3\n\n1.25 = 5/4, so (5√3/2) / (5/4) = (5√3/2)*(4/5) = 2√3\n\nSo 2√3 t = 1 + s  => s = 2√3 t - 1  ...(3)\n\nNow plug into (1):\n\n5 - 2.5t = 2.5√3/2 (1 - s) = (5√3/4) (1 - s)  [since 2.5 = 5/2, so (5/2)*(√3/2) = 5√3/4]\n\nSo:\n\n5 - 2.5t = (5√3/4) (1 - s)\n\nSubstitute s from (3):\n\n5 - 2.5t = (5√3/4) (1 - (2√3 t - 1)) = (5√3/4) (1 - 2√3 t + 1) = (5√3/4) (2 - 2√3 t) = (5√3/4)*2 (1 - √3 t) = (5√3/2) (1 - √3 t)\n\nSo:\n\n5 - 2.5t = (5√3/2) - (5√3/2)*√3 t = (5√3/2) - (5*3/2) t = (5√3/2) - (15/2) t\n\nBring all terms to left:\n\n5 - 2.5t - 5√3/2 + (15/2) t = 0\n\nCombine t terms: (-2.5 + 7.5) t = 5t? -2.5t + 7.5t = 5t\n\nConstants: 5 - 5√3/2\n\nSo:\n\n5t + 5 - 5√3/2 = 0\n\nDivide by 5:\n\nt + 1 - √3/2 = 0\n\nt = √3/2 - 1\n\n√3 ≈ 1.732, so √3/2 ≈ 0.866, so t ≈ 0.866 - 1 = -0.134 < 0, not in [0,1]\n\nSo no intersection with AB.\n\nNow try with side BC of outer hexagon.\n\nSide BC: from B(2.5, 5√3/2) to C(-2.5, 5√3/2) — this is a horizontal side at y = 5√3/2, from x=2.5 to x=-2.5.\n\nInner side GH: from G(2.5√3/2, 1.25) to H(0, 2.5)\n\nThis side has y from 1.25 to 2.5, while BC is at y=5√3/2 ≈ 4.33, which is higher, so no intersection.\n\nNow try side CD: from C(-2.5, 5√3/2) to D(-5, 0)\n\nParametrize CD: t from 0 to 1\n\nx = -2.5 + t*(-5 +2.5) = -2.5 -2.5t\n\ny = 5√3/2 + t*(0 - 5√3/2) = (5√3/2)(1 - t)\n\nInner side GH: x = 2.5√3/2 (1 - s), y = 1.25 + 1.25s\n\nSet equal:\n\n-2.5 -2.5t = 2.5√3/2 (1 - s)  ...(1)\n\n(5√3/2)(1 - t) = 1.25 + 1.25s  ...(2)\n\nFrom (2): (5√3/2)(1 - t) = 1.25(1 + s)\n\nDivide both sides by 1.25: 2√3 (1 - t) = 1 + s  => s = 2√3 (1 - t) - 1  ...(3)\n\nPlug into (1):\n\n-2.5 -2.5t = (5√3/4) (1 - s)  [same as before]\n\nSubstitute s:\n\n1 - s = 1 - [2√3 (1 - t) - 1] = 1 -2√3 +2√3 t +1 = 2 -2√3 +2√3 t\n\nSo:\n\n-2.5 -2.5t = (5√3/4) * (2 -2√3 +2√3 t) = (5√3/4)*2 (1 - √3 + √3 t) = (5√3/2) (1 - √3 + √3 t)\n\nCompute right side: (5√3/2) - (5*3/2) + (5*3/2) t = (5√3/2) - 15/2 + (15/2) t\n\nSo:\n\n-2.5 -2.5t = 5√3/2 - 7.5 + 7.5t\n\nBring all to left:\n\n-2.5 -2.5t -5√3/2 +7.5 -7.5t = 0\n\nConstants: -2.5 +7.5 = 5, so 5 -5√3/2\n\nt terms: -2.5t -7.5t = -10t\n\nSo:\n\n-10t + 5 - 5√3/2 = 0\n\n10t = 5 - 5√3/2 = 5(1 - √3/2)\n\nt = (1/2) (1 - √3/2) = 1/2 - √3/4\n\n√3/4 ≈ 1.732/4 = 0.433, so t ≈ 0.5 - 0.433 = 0.067 >0, and less than 1? 0.067<1, yes.\n\ns from (3): s = 2√3 (1 - t) - 1\n\n1 - t = 1 - (1/2 - √3/4) = 1/2 + √3/4\n\ns = 2√3 (1/2 + √3/4) - 1 = 2√3 * 1/2 + 2√3 * √3/4 - 1 = √3 + (2*3)/4 - 1 = √3 + 6/4 - 1 = √3 + 1.5 - 1 = √3 + 0.5 ≈ 1.732 + 0.5 = 2.232 >1, not in [0,1]\n\nSo s>1, not on the segment.\n\nSo no intersection.\n\nThis is taking too long. Perhaps for this configuration, the inner hexagon's sides do not intersect the outer hexagon's sides, since it's scaled by 1/2 and rotated, and 2.5 < apothem 4.33, so it's completely inside, and may not intersect the sides.\n\nIn that case, the 13 points might be the 6 vertices of outer, 6 of inner, and the center O1, but that's 13? 6+6+1=13, yes!\n\nOh! I think I missed that. The 13 points are: 6 vertices of outer hexagon, 6 of inner hexagon, and the center O1.\n\nThat makes 13 points.\n\nAnd the problem says \"a line segment is drawn connecting point F and point D, both lying on the sides of the outer hexagon.\"\n\nIn the diagram, F and D are likely vertices of the outer hexagon, as labeled.\n\nSo F and D are vertices, and we need distance between them.\n\nAs calculated earlier, if D is at (-5,0), F is at (2.5, -5√3/2), then distance is sqrt( (2.5 +5)^2 + ( -5√3/2 -0)^2 ) = sqrt(7.5^2 + (5√3/2)^2) = sqrt(56.25 + 18.75) = sqrt(75) = 5√3.\n\nAnd in a regular hexagon, the distance between vertices separated by two steps is s√3 = 5√3.\n\nSo I think that's the answer.\n\nPerhaps the rotation is applied to the outer hexagon, but that doesn't change the distance.\n\nOr perhaps the labeling is different, but in standard labeling, it should be fine.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}}"
