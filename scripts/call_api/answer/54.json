    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle. Points D, E, and F are additional points of tangency or intersection: D lies on arc AB, E is the midpoint of chord BC, and F lies on arc AC. In the final configuration, segment FE is drawn connecting point F to midpoint E.\n\nWhat is the radian value of the angle between line AB and line CA at vertex A?

    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric circles and a triangle circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices on the larger circle. We are to find the **radian measure of the angle at vertex A** — that is, angle BAC — expressed as a multiple of π.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup\n\n- There is a **smaller circle** centered at O1 with radius 5.\n- It is scaled **concentrically by factor 2**, so the **larger circle** has radius 10, same center O1.\n- Triangle ABC is **circumscribed about the smaller circle** — meaning the smaller circle is the **incircle** of triangle ABC.\n- The **vertices A, B, C lie on the larger circle** — so triangle ABC is **inscribed in the larger circle** (i.e., the circumcircle of triangle ABC has radius 10).\n- So, triangle ABC has:\n  - **Incircle** of radius 5 (centered at O1),\n  - **Circumcircle** of radius 10 (also centered at O1).\n\nThis is a very special configuration: a triangle whose **incenter and circumcenter coincide**. That only happens for **equilateral triangles**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Key geometric fact\n\n> In any triangle, the incenter and circumcenter coincide **if and only if** the triangle is **equilateral**.\n\n**Proof sketch**: In an equilateral triangle, all centers (centroid, circumcenter, incenter, orthocenter) coincide. Conversely, if incenter and circumcenter coincide, then the triangle must be equilateral — because the incenter is the intersection of angle bisectors, and the circumcenter is the intersection of perpendicular bisectors; for them to coincide, symmetry forces all angles and sides to be equal.\n\nThus, triangle ABC is **equilateral**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Angle at vertex A\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, **all angles are equal**, and since the sum of angles in any triangle is π radians (180°), each angle is:\n\n\\[\n\\angle BAC = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify consistency with other given points\n\nThe problem mentions points D, E, F:\n\n- D lies on arc AB (of the larger circle),\n- E is the midpoint of chord BC,\n- F lies on arc AC,\n- Segment FE is drawn.\n\nBut **none of these are needed** to compute angle BAC, because the key insight — that the incenter and circumcenter coincide — forces the triangle to be equilateral, and thus the angle is π/3.\n\nEven if we were to use coordinates or trigonometry, we’d arrive at the same conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n\\]"
