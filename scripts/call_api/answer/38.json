    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two concentric regular hexagons:\n\n- **Outer hexagon**: regular, side length = 5, centered at O1.\n- **Inner hexagon**: also regular, scaled down by factor 1/2 (so side length = 2.5), same center O1.\n- The outer hexagon is **rotated by π/6 radians** (30 degrees) relative to the inner one.\n- Points A through K (and O1) are labeled at vertices and intersections — total 13 distinct points.\n- We are to find the length of segment **FD**, where F and D lie on the **outer hexagon’s sides**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure\n\nA regular hexagon can be inscribed in a circle, with all vertices lying on the circle. The distance from center to any vertex (radius) equals the side length.\n\nSo, for the **outer hexagon**:\n- Side length = 5 → radius (distance from O1 to any vertex) = 5.\n- It is rotated by π/6 radians. We’ll assume this rotation is relative to the inner hexagon, which we can take as aligned with the coordinate axes for simplicity.\n\nThe **inner hexagon**:\n- Side length = 2.5 → radius = 2.5.\n- Not rotated (we can assume it’s aligned with standard position for simplicity).\n\nBut the problem says the **outer hexagon is rotated by π/6**, so we’ll model the outer hexagon as rotated 30° relative to the inner one.\n\nPoints A through K are labeled at vertices and intersections — so likely, the 6 vertices of the outer hexagon, 6 vertices of the inner hexagon, and O1 — that’s 13 points.\n\nBut the problem says: “Points A through K, along with O1, are labeled at the vertices and intersections of the two hexagons, totaling 13 distinct points.” So A–K = 11 points, plus O1 = 12? Wait — 11 + 1 = 12, but it says 13. Hmm.\n\nWait — perhaps A–K is 11 letters? A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K → 11 points. Plus O1 → 12. But problem says 13. So perhaps one of the points is labeled twice? Or maybe I miscount.\n\nActually, standard labeling: A to K is 11 letters. But 11 + 1 (O1) = 12. So perhaps there is an error in the problem? Or maybe “A through K” includes 12 points? No, A to K is 11.\n\nWait — perhaps the labeling includes both hexagons’ vertices and some intersection points? But two regular hexagons, concentric, one rotated by 30°, will intersect at 12 points? Or maybe not.\n\nActually, let’s think differently. Perhaps the diagram is given, and from the diagram, we can deduce positions.\n\nLooking at the diagram description (even though we can’t see it, the problem mentions it), and the labels:\n\nFrom the description:\n\n- Outer hexagon vertices: A, B, C, D, E, F — that’s 6 points.\n- Inner hexagon vertices: G, H, I, J, K — that’s 5? Wait, 6 vertices needed.\n\nWait — the inner hexagon has 6 vertices. So perhaps G, H, I, J, K, and one more? But only A–K are labeled, which is 11 letters.\n\nWait — perhaps O1 is not counted in A–K, and A–K are 11 points, so 11 + 1 = 12, but problem says 13. This is confusing.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps “A through K” is a misstatement, and it’s meant to be 12 points plus O1? Or maybe one of the points is shared?\n\nActually, let’s ignore the labeling count for now and focus on the key: **F and D are on the outer hexagon’s sides**, and we need to find FD.\n\nAlso, from the diagram description (which we have to infer), the outer hexagon is labeled A, B, C, D, E, F — going around.\n\nIn a regular hexagon, opposite vertices are separated by 2 side lengths. But here, we are to find distance between F and D — which are not necessarily opposite.\n\nIn a regular hexagon, if we label vertices consecutively A, B, C, D, E, F, then:\n\n- A to B: side\n- A to C: 2 sides apart → distance = 2 * side * sin(60°) ? Wait, better to use coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use coordinate geometry\n\nLet’s place the center O1 at the origin (0,0).\n\nAssume the **inner hexagon** is aligned with the x-axis — so its vertices are at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°.\n\nBut the **outer hexagon is rotated by π/6 = 30°**, so its vertices are at angles 30°, 90°, 150°, 210°, 270°, 330°.\n\nSince both are regular hexagons centered at O1, and outer has radius 5, inner has radius 2.5.\n\nBut the problem says: “a concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it” — so inner hexagon is inside outer, same center, scaled by 1/2.\n\nNow, points A through K are labeled at vertices and intersections. But for our purpose, we only care about points F and D on the outer hexagon.\n\nFrom the diagram description, it seems that the outer hexagon is labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in order.\n\nAssuming standard labeling: starting from the rightmost vertex (angle 0°), but since it’s rotated by 30°, the first vertex is at 30°.\n\nSo let’s define the outer hexagon vertices:\n\nLet’s label them in counter-clockwise order, starting from angle 30°:\n\n- Vertex A: angle 30°, radius 5\n- Vertex B: angle 90°, radius 5\n- Vertex C: angle 150°, radius 5\n- Vertex D: angle 210°, radius 5\n- Vertex E: angle 270°, radius 5\n- Vertex F: angle 330°, radius 5\n\nSo:\n\n- A: (5 cos 30°, 5 sin 30°)\n- B: (5 cos 90°, 5 sin 90°) = (0, 5)\n- C: (5 cos 150°, 5 sin 150°)\n- D: (5 cos 210°, 5 sin 210°)\n- E: (5 cos 270°, 5 sin 270°) = (0, -5)\n- F: (5 cos 330°, 5 sin 330°)\n\nWe need to find distance between F and D.\n\nSo let’s compute coordinates of F and D.\n\nFirst, recall:\n\ncos 330° = cos(-30°) = cos 30° = √3/2\n\nsin 330° = sin(-30°) = -sin 30° = -1/2\n\ncos 210° = cos(180°+30°) = -cos 30° = -√3/2\n\nsin 210° = sin(180°+30°) = -sin 30° = -1/2\n\nSo:\n\nF: (5 * √3/2, 5 * (-1/2)) = ( (5√3)/2 , -5/2 )\n\nD: (5 * (-√3/2), 5 * (-1/2)) = ( - (5√3)/2 , -5/2 )\n\nNow, distance FD:\n\nBoth points have the same y-coordinate: y = -5/2\n\nSo distance is just the absolute difference in x-coordinates.\n\nx_F - x_D = (5√3)/2 - ( -5√3/2 ) = (5√3)/2 + (5√3)/2 = 5√3\n\nSo distance FD = |x_F - x_D| = 5√3\n\nSince y-coordinates are equal, distance = |Δx| = 5√3\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify\n\nWe can also use distance formula:\n\nFD² = (x_F - x_D)^2 + (y_F - y_D)^2\n\nx_F - x_D = (5√3)/2 - (-5√3)/2 = 5√3\n\ny_F - y_D = (-5/2) - (-5/2) = 0\n\nSo FD² = (5√3)^2 + 0 = 25 * 3 = 75\n\nFD = √75 = 5√3\n\nYes.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe length of segment FD is \\( 5\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\nNote: The problem mentions the inner hexagon and rotation, but for points F and D, which are vertices of the outer hexagon, and since we computed their positions based on the rotation, and the distance came out cleanly, and the inner hexagon doesn't affect FD (since F and D are on the outer hexagon), we don't need the inner hexagon for this calculation.\n\nThe rotation was necessary to determine the positions of F and D — if the hexagon weren't rotated, F and D might be different points, but in this labeling, with rotation, we got F at 330° and D at 210°, which are symmetric about the y-axis, same y, so distance is horizontal.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}}"
