  "answer": [
    "We are given a circle O₁ with radius 5 units, and triangle ABC is inscribed in it (meaning all three vertices lie on the circle). However, the question asks only for the **circumference** of circle O₁.\n\nThe fact that triangle ABC is inscribed is **irrelevant** to computing the circumference — it’s just context. The only thing we need is the radius.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Recall the formula for circumference of a circle\n\nThe circumference $ C $ of a circle is given by:\n\n$$\nC = 2\\pi r\n$$\n\nwhere $ r $ is the radius.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Substitute the given radius\n\nWe are told the radius $ r = 5 $ units.\n\n$$\nC = 2\\pi \\cdot 5 = 10\\pi\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nThe circumference of circle O₁ is $ 10\\pi $ units.\n\n---\n\n$$\n\\boxed{10\\pi}\n$$"
