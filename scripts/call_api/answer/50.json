    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, centered at O1, with vertices lying on the larger circle. Points D and E lie on the sides of this triangle and also on the smaller circle.

    "We are given a geometric construction with two concentric circles:\n\n- Smaller circle: center O1, radius 5.\n- Larger circle: concentric with the smaller one, radius 10 (obtained by scaling the smaller circle by factor 2).\n- A triangle is circumscribed about the smaller circle (i.e., the smaller circle is the **incircle** of the triangle), and the triangle’s **vertices lie on the larger circle**.\n- Points D and E lie on the **sides** of the triangle and also on the **smaller circle**.\n- We are to find the length of segment DE.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\nWe have:\n\n- A triangle circumscribed about a circle (incircle) of radius 5.\n- The triangle’s vertices lie on a circle of radius 10 centered at the same point O1.\n- So, the triangle is **tangential** (has an incircle) and **cyclic** (vertices lie on a circle) — i.e., it is a **bicentric triangle**.\n\nMoreover, since both circles are concentric, the incenter and circumcenter coincide — meaning the triangle is **equilateral**.\n\n> **Key Insight**: The only triangles that are both tangential and cyclic with **coincident incenter and circumcenter** are **equilateral triangles**.\n\nSo, the triangle must be equilateral.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Properties of an equilateral triangle with incircle and circumcircle\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- Side length of equilateral triangle: $ s $\n- Inradius: $ r = 5 $\n- Circumradius: $ R = 10 $\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the relationship between side length $ s $, inradius $ r $, and circumradius $ R $ is:\n\n$$\nr = \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}}, \\quad R = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nCheck consistency:\n\nGiven $ r = 5 $, then:\n\n$$\ns = 2\\sqrt{3} \\cdot r = 2\\sqrt{3} \\cdot 5 = 10\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nThen circumradius:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = 10\n$$\n\nPerfect — matches the given circumradius. So the triangle is equilateral with side length $ 10\\sqrt{3} $, inradius 5, circumradius 10.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Points D and E lie on the sides of the triangle and on the incircle\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the incircle touches each side at its **midpoint**.\n\n> Why? Because of symmetry — the incenter coincides with centroid, and in an equilateral triangle, the angle bisectors, medians, and altitudes all coincide. So the point where the incircle touches a side is the midpoint of that side.\n\nSo, the points where the incircle touches the sides are the **midpoints** of the sides.\n\nTherefore, if D and E are two such points (on the incircle and on the sides), then they are **midpoints of two sides** of the equilateral triangle.\n\nWe are to find the distance between two such midpoints — i.e., the distance between midpoints of two sides of an equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute distance between midpoints of two sides of an equilateral triangle\n\nLet’s place the equilateral triangle in the coordinate plane for clarity.\n\nLet’s place the triangle with:\n\n- Vertex A at $ (0, 0) $\n- Vertex B at $ (s, 0) = (10\\sqrt{3}, 0) $\n- Vertex C at $ \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{s\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\left( 5\\sqrt{3}, 15 \\right) $\n\nWait — let’s verify that:\n\nIn an equilateral triangle with side length $ s $, height is $ h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s $, so if base is from (0,0) to (s,0), then top vertex is at $ \\left( \\frac{s}{2}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s \\right) $\n\nSo with $ s = 10\\sqrt{3} $:\n\n- A: $ (0, 0) $\n- B: $ (10\\sqrt{3}, 0) $\n- C: $ \\left( 5\\sqrt{3}, \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} \\right) = \\left( 5\\sqrt{3}, \\frac{10 \\cdot 3}{2} \\right) = (5\\sqrt{3}, 15) $\n\nNow, find midpoints of sides:\n\nLet’s say:\n\n- Midpoint of AB: M_AB = $ \\left( \\frac{0 + 10\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{0 + 0}{2} \\right) = (5\\sqrt{3}, 0) $\n- Midpoint of BC: M_BC = $ \\left( \\frac{10\\sqrt{3} + 5\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{0 + 15}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{15\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 7.5 \\right) $\n- Midpoint of AC: M_AC = $ \\left( \\frac{0 + 5\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\frac{0 + 15}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 7.5 \\right) $\n\nNow, D and E are two of these midpoints — since they lie on the incircle and on the sides.\n\nWe are to find DE — the distance between two such midpoints.\n\nWhich two? The problem doesn’t specify, but since the triangle is equilateral and symmetric, the distance between any two midpoints of sides is the same — because of rotational symmetry.\n\nWait — is that true?\n\nLet’s compute distance between M_AB and M_AC:\n\nM_AB = $ (5\\sqrt{3}, 0) $\n\nM_AC = $ \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 7.5 \\right) $\n\nDifference in x: $ 5\\sqrt{3} - \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} $\n\nDifference in y: $ 0 - 7.5 = -7.5 $\n\nSo distance:\n\n$$\nDE = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)^2 + (-7.5)^2 } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{25 \\cdot 3}{4} + 56.25 } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{75}{4} + \\frac{225}{4} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{300}{4} } = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nWait — let’s check distance between M_AB and M_BC:\n\nM_AB = $ (5\\sqrt{3}, 0) $\n\nM_BC = $ \\left( \\frac{15\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 7.5 \\right) $\n\nΔx = $ \\frac{15\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 5\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{15\\sqrt{3} - 10\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} $\n\nΔy = 7.5 - 0 = 7.5\n\nSame as before — distance = $ \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)^2 + (7.5)^2 } = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3} $\n\nSimilarly, distance between M_AC and M_BC:\n\nM_AC = $ \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 7.5 \\right) $\n\nM_BC = $ \\left( \\frac{15\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 7.5 \\right) $\n\nΔx = $ \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 5\\sqrt{3} $, Δy = 0 → distance = $ 5\\sqrt{3} $\n\nSo **all distances between midpoints of sides are equal to $ 5\\sqrt{3} $**.\n\nThus, regardless of which two points D and E we pick (as long as they are midpoints of different sides), DE = $ 5\\sqrt{3} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Confirm that these midpoints lie on the incircle\n\nThe incircle is centered at O1, which is the centroid (and incenter) of the equilateral triangle.\n\nCoordinates of centroid O1:\n\nAverage of vertices:\n\n$$\nO1 = \\left( \\frac{0 + 10\\sqrt{3} + 5\\sqrt{3}}{3}, \\frac{0 + 0 + 15}{3} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{15\\sqrt{3}}{3}, \\frac{15}{3} \\right) = (5\\sqrt{3}, 5)\n$$\n\nNow, check distance from O1 to M_AB = $ (5\\sqrt{3}, 0) $:\n\nΔx = 0, Δy = -5 → distance = 5 — matches inradius.\n\nSimilarly, to M_AC = $ \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}, 7.5 \\right) $:\n\nΔx = $ \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 5\\sqrt{3} = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} $\n\nΔy = 7.5 - 5 = 2.5\n\nDistance squared:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)^2 + (2.5)^2 = \\frac{75}{4} + \\frac{25}{4} = \\frac{100}{4} = 25 \\Rightarrow \\text{distance} = 5\n$$\n\nSame for M_BC.\n\nSo yes, all three midpoints lie on the incircle.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe length of segment DE is $ \\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}} $.\n\n---\n\n✅ All steps verified. The key was recognizing the triangle must be equilateral due to concentric incircle and circumcircle, then computing distance between midpoints of sides.\n\n---\n\n**Answer:** $ \\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}} $"
