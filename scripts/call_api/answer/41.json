    "We are given a diagram involving two concentric regular hexagons: an outer one with side length 5, and an inner one scaled by 1/2, both centered at O1. The outer hexagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in order. The inner hexagon has vertices G, H, I, J, K, L, with H lying at the intersection of segment CA and the top side of the inner hexagon.\n\nWe are to find the **radian measure of angle ∠BAF**, formed at vertex A by segments AB and AF.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular hexagon\n\nIn a **regular hexagon**, all internal angles are 120°, and the central angle between adjacent vertices is 60° (since 360°/6 = 60°).\n\nVertices are equally spaced around the center. If we label the vertices in order (say, counterclockwise), then the angle between any two adjacent vertices, as seen from the center, is π/3 radians (60°).\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine positions of points A, B, and F\n\nAssume the outer hexagon is labeled **counterclockwise** as: A, B, C, D, E, F.\n\nSo, starting at A, the next vertex is B, then C, D, E, F, and back to A.\n\nTherefore:\n\n- Segment AB connects A to the next vertex (B).\n- Segment AF connects A to the previous vertex (F).\n\nSo, **∠BAF** is the angle at vertex A between the two adjacent sides AB and AF — that is, the **internal angle** of the hexagon at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Recall internal angle of a regular hexagon\n\nThe formula for the internal angle of a regular polygon with n sides is:\n\n> Internal angle = (n - 2) × π / n\n\nFor a hexagon, n = 6:\n\n> Internal angle = (6 - 2) × π / 6 = 4π/6 = **2π/3 radians**\n\nSo, ∠BAF = 2π/3.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify with geometry\n\nAlternatively, think of the hexagon as composed of 6 equilateral triangles from the center.\n\nAt vertex A, the two adjacent vertices are B and F. The angle between vectors AB and AF (from point A) is the internal angle.\n\nIn a regular hexagon, each internal angle is **120°**, which is **2π/3 radians**.\n\nThis is a standard result.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Consider if rotation or inner hexagon affects this\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n- The hexagon is rotated by π/6 radians.\n- There is an inner hexagon scaled by 1/2.\n- Point H is the intersection of CA and the inner hexagon’s top side.\n\nHowever, **none of this affects the internal angle at vertex A of the outer hexagon**.\n\nThe angle ∠BAF is purely a property of the outer hexagon’s geometry — specifically, the angle between two adjacent sides meeting at vertex A.\n\nRotation does not change internal angles — it only changes orientation.\n\nThe inner hexagon and point H are red herrings for this particular question.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
