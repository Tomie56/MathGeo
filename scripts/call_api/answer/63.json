    "In the given diagram, triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle centered at O1 with radius 5. Points A, B, and C lie on the circumference, forming chords AB, BC, and AC. The arc BC (denoted Arc_B_C) is the minor arc connecting points B and C along the circle’s circumference.\n\nCalculate the length of arc BC, given that triangle ABC is equilateral and inscribed in the circle."

  "answer": [
    "We are given:\n\n- Triangle ABC is **equilateral** and **inscribed** in a circle centered at O1.\n- The **radius** of the circle is **5**.\n- We are to find the **length of arc BC**, which is the **minor arc** between points B and C.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral and inscribed in a circle, it is a **regular triangle inscribed in a circle** — meaning all its vertices lie on the circle, and all sides and angles are equal.\n\nIn such a case, the central angles corresponding to each side of the triangle are equal.\n\nThe circle is 360°, and since the triangle is equilateral, the three arcs between the vertices (arc AB, arc BC, arc CA) are equal.\n\nTherefore:\n\n> **Each arc (AB, BC, CA) corresponds to 360° / 3 = 120°**\n\nSo, arc BC is a **120° arc** of the circle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use arc length formula\n\nThe formula for the **length of an arc** is:\n\n> **Arc Length = (θ / 360°) × 2πr**\n\nWhere:\n- θ is the central angle in degrees,\n- r is the radius.\n\nHere:\n- θ = 120°\n- r = 5\n\nSubstitute into the formula:\n\n> Arc Length BC = (120 / 360) × 2π × 5\n\nSimplify:\n\n> = (1/3) × 10π  \n> = **10π / 3**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nThe length of arc BC is **10π/3**.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Answer:**\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{10\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
