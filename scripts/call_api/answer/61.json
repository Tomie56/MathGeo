    "Two circles, Circle O₁ and Circle O₂, are shown in the figure. Circle O₁ has center O₁ and radius 5. Circle O₂ is obtained by translating Circle O₁ vertically downward such that the two circles are externally tangent at point A. Calculate the circumference (length) of Circle O₁."

  "answer": [
    "We are given a geometry problem involving two circles. Let’s break it down step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understand what is being asked**\n\nWe are asked to **calculate the circumference of Circle O₁**.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- Circle O₁ has center O₁ and **radius 5**.\n- Circle O₂ is obtained by **translating Circle O₁ vertically downward** such that the two circles are **externally tangent at point A**.\n\nNote: The fact that Circle O₂ is a translation of Circle O₁ and they are externally tangent is **irrelevant** to the question of finding the **circumference of Circle O₁**, because the circumference depends **only** on the radius of Circle O₁.\n\nSo, even though the problem gives extra information about Circle O₂ and the point of tangency, we don’t need it to compute the circumference of Circle O₁.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Recall the formula for circumference of a circle**\n\nThe circumference $ C $ of a circle is given by:\n\n$$\nC = 2\\pi r\n$$\n\nwhere $ r $ is the radius.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Plug in the given radius**\n\nWe are told that the radius of Circle O₁ is 5.\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nC = 2\\pi \\cdot 5 = 10\\pi\n$$\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Final Answer**\n\nThe circumference of Circle O₁ is $ 10\\pi $.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Note**: The information about Circle O₂ and point A is a red herring — it’s there to possibly distract or test whether you focus on what’s actually needed. Since the question only asks for the circumference of Circle O₁, and we are given its radius, we can ignore the rest.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$$\n\\boxed{10\\pi}\n$$"
