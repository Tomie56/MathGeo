    "We are given a large circle centered at O1 with radius 10, circumscribing an equilateral triangle ABC. A smaller concentric circle (same center O1) with radius 5 is inscribed in the triangle — it is tangent to the sides of the triangle at points D, E, F. We are to find the length of segment DB, where D is the point of tangency on side AB, and B is a vertex of the triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral and circumscribed by a circle of radius 10, that circle is the **circumcircle** of triangle ABC. The smaller circle of radius 5 is the **incircle** of triangle ABC, since it is tangent to all three sides and concentric (same center) — which only happens in an equilateral triangle.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the incenter and circumcenter coincide — that’s why both circles are centered at O1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use known relations in an equilateral triangle\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- R = circumradius = 10\n- r = inradius = 5\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the relationship between the circumradius R and inradius r is:\n\n> **r = R / 2**\n\nIndeed, here r = 5 and R = 10, so this checks out.\n\nAlso, in an equilateral triangle with side length s:\n\n- Circumradius: R = s / √3\n- Inradius: r = s / (2√3)\n\nWait — let’s verify that.\n\nActually, standard formulas for equilateral triangle:\n\n- Height h = (√3 / 2) * s\n- Centroid (which is also incenter and circumcenter) divides the height in 2:1 ratio.\n\nSo:\n\n- Circumradius R = (2/3) * h = (2/3) * (√3 / 2) * s = (√3 / 3) * s = s / √3\n- Inradius r = (1/3) * h = (1/3) * (√3 / 2) * s = (√3 / 6) * s = s / (2√3)\n\nSo, indeed, r = R / 2, since:\n\nR = s / √3  \nr = s / (2√3) = R / 2\n\nPerfect.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find side length s of triangle ABC\n\nWe are given R = 10.\n\nFrom R = s / √3 → s = R * √3 = 10√3\n\nSo each side of triangle ABC is 10√3.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find length DB\n\nPoint D is the point of tangency of the incircle with side AB.\n\nIn any triangle, the distance from a vertex to the point of tangency of the incircle with the adjacent side is equal to the **semiperimeter minus the opposite side**.\n\nBut since this is an equilateral triangle, we can use symmetry.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the incircle touches each side at its **midpoint**.\n\nWait — is that true?\n\nActually, yes! Because of symmetry: in an equilateral triangle, the incenter coincides with the centroid, and the perpendicular from the incenter to any side hits the midpoint of that side.\n\nSo, D is the **midpoint** of AB.\n\nTherefore, AD = DB = AB / 2 = (10√3) / 2 = 5√3\n\n---\n\n### But wait — let’s double-check this reasoning.\n\nIs the point of tangency of the incircle with a side of an equilateral triangle really the midpoint?\n\nYes. Because:\n\n- The incenter is equidistant from all sides.\n- The perpendicular from the incenter to a side is the radius (5), and in an equilateral triangle, this perpendicular also bisects the side (due to symmetry).\n\nSo yes, D is the midpoint of AB.\n\nTherefore, DB = AB / 2 = (10√3)/2 = 5√3\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}}\n$$"
