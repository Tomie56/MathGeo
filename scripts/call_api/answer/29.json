    "We are given a regular hexagon ABCDEF with center O1 and side length 5. A smaller, concentric, scaled-down hexagon GHIJKL (scaled by 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center. We are to find the measure of angle **B-A-F**, i.e., the angle at vertex A formed by segments AB and AF.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular hexagon\n\nIn a **regular hexagon**, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are equal. The internal angle at each vertex is:\n\n> **Internal angle of regular hexagon** = $ \\frac{(n-2) \\cdot \\pi}{n} = \\frac{4\\pi}{6} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} $ radians.\n\nBut note: the question asks for **angle B-A-F**, which is the angle formed at vertex A by the two adjacent sides: **AB** and **AF**.\n\nWait — in a regular hexagon labeled sequentially (A, B, C, D, E, F), the vertices are arranged in order around the center. So, from vertex A, the two adjacent vertices are **B** and **F**.\n\nTherefore, **angle B-A-F** is exactly the **internal angle** at vertex A of the regular hexagon.\n\nSo, if that’s the case, the answer is simply $ \\frac{2\\pi}{3} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check if rotation or the inner hexagon affects this\n\nThe problem states:\n\n> “a regular hexagon ABCDEF ... is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon ... is inscribed within it...”\n\nBut **rotation** of the entire hexagon around its center does **not** change the internal angles — it only changes the orientation in the plane. The angle at vertex A between AB and AF remains the same.\n\nAlso, the inner hexagon is **concentric and scaled**, but **does not affect** the angle at vertex A of the outer hexagon — we are only concerned with points A, B, and F, which are vertices of the outer hexagon.\n\nSo, the inner hexagon and the rotation are **red herrings** — they are included to possibly distract or test whether the solver recognizes that the angle in question is purely a property of the regular hexagon’s geometry.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm labeling and adjacency\n\nIn a regular hexagon labeled **A, B, C, D, E, F** in order (say, clockwise), the neighbors of A are **B** and **F**.\n\nThus, angle B-A-F is the angle between vectors AB and AF — which is the **internal angle** at A.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the internal angle is:\n\n> $ \\theta = \\frac{(n-2)\\pi}{n} $\n\nFor n = 6:\n\n> $ \\theta = \\frac{4\\pi}{6} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} $\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Alternative approach using central angles\n\nWe can also think in terms of central angles.\n\nIn a regular hexagon, each central angle (angle from center O1 to two adjacent vertices) is $ \\frac{2\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} $.\n\nThe angle at vertex A can be found using the fact that triangle A-O1-B and A-O1-F are both isosceles triangles with two sides equal to the radius of the circumcircle.\n\nIn fact, the triangle A-B-F is an isosceles triangle with AB = AF = side length, and angle at A being the internal angle.\n\nAlternatively, since the hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles (each with central angle π/3), and each triangle has internal angles of π/3, then the internal angle at the vertex is composed of two of those π/3 angles from adjacent triangles — but wait, that’s not quite right.\n\nActually, in the triangle formed by two adjacent vertices and the center (e.g., A-O1-B), the angle at O1 is π/3, and the two base angles (at A and B) are equal. Since the triangle is isosceles with OA = OB, and angle at O is π/3, then the other two angles are:\n\n> $ \\frac{\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{3}}{2} = \\frac{2\\pi}{6} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} $\n\nSo triangle A-O1-B is equilateral — all angles π/3.\n\nBut the internal angle at A of the hexagon is the angle between AB and AF — which is **not** the angle in triangle A-O1-B.\n\nActually, to get angle B-A-F, consider triangle A-B-F.\n\nPoints B and F are both adjacent to A, so arc B-F (not passing through A) spans 4 sides of the hexagon? Wait — no.\n\nIn a regular hexagon, from B to F going the short way: B → C → D → E → F is 4 steps, but the short way is B → A → F, which is 2 steps. So the arc from B to F passing through A is 2 steps, meaning the central angle for arc B-F (minor arc) is 2 × π/3 = 2π/3.\n\nBut we want the angle at A, which is an **inscribed angle** subtending arc B-F.\n\nWait — is angle B-A-F an inscribed angle?\n\nActually, **yes**. Point A is on the circumference, and angle B-A-F subtends arc B-F.\n\nIn circle geometry, the measure of an inscribed angle is **half** the measure of the central angle subtending the same arc.\n\nSo, if arc B-F (not passing through A) has central angle θ, then angle at A is θ/2.\n\nBut which arc? The arc **not** containing A.\n\nIn the hexagon, the arc from B to F that does **not** pass through A goes through C, D, E — that’s 4 sides, so central angle = 4 × π/3 = 4π/3.\n\nThen the inscribed angle at A subtending that arc would be half of that: 2π/3.\n\nAlternatively, the arc from B to F passing through A is 2 sides: central angle = 2π/3, so the inscribed angle subtending the **other** arc (the major arc) is half of 4π/3 = 2π/3.\n\nWait — actually, the inscribed angle at A subtending arc B-F (the arc that does **not** include A) is half of 4π/3 = 2π/3.\n\nYes — this confirms the internal angle is 2π/3.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe measure of angle B-A-F is $ \\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} $ radians.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Answer: $ \\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}} $**"
