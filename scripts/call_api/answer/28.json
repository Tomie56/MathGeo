    "We are given a regular hexagon with center O1 and side length 5. The vertices are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in counterclockwise order, starting from the rightmost vertex. We are asked to calculate the length of line segment AB.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular hexagon\n\nIn a **regular hexagon**, all sides are equal in length, and all internal angles are 120 degrees. Importantly, in a regular hexagon, the distance from the center to any vertex (the radius of the circumscribed circle) is equal to the side length.\n\nSo, if the side length is 5, then the distance from the center O1 to any vertex (like A or B) is also 5.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the angle between two adjacent vertices from the center\n\nSince the hexagon is regular and has 6 sides, the angle between two adjacent vertices, as seen from the center, is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{360^\\circ}{6} = 60^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo, angle ∠AO1B = 60°.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use the Law of Cosines to find AB\n\nWe can consider triangle AO1B, where:\n\n- O1A = 5 (radius)\n- O1B = 5 (radius)\n- ∠AO1B = 60°\n\nWe want to find the length of side AB.\n\nUsing the **Law of Cosines**:\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = O1A^2 + O1B^2 - 2 \\cdot O1A \\cdot O1B \\cdot \\cos(\\angle AO1B)\n\\]\n\nSubstitute the known values:\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = 5^2 + 5^2 - 2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 5 \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = 25 + 25 - 50 \\cdot \\cos(60^\\circ)\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\(\\cos(60^\\circ) = 0.5\\), so:\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = 50 - 50 \\cdot 0.5 = 50 - 25 = 25\n\\]\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{25} = 5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Interpret the result\n\nThis makes perfect sense: in a regular hexagon, the side length is equal to the radius. So the distance between two adjacent vertices (like A and B) is exactly the side length — which is given as 5.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Address the mention of the inner hexagon\n\nThe problem mentions a smaller, concentric hexagon scaled by 1/2. However, the question asks only for the length of AB, which is a side of the **outer** hexagon. The inner hexagon is irrelevant to this particular calculation.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]"
