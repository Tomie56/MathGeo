    "We are given a **regular octagon** with center **O1** and side length **3**. A **square** is inscribed such that:\n\n- One of its **vertices coincides with O1** (the center of the octagon).\n- The **center of the square is at point E**.\n- Points **H** and **O1** lie on segments of the combined figure.\n- We are to find the length of segment **H–O1**.\n\n---\n\nLet’s break this down step by step.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the regular octagon\n\nA regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal angles. The distance from the center to any vertex is called the **radius** (or circumradius), denoted **R**.\n\nFor a regular octagon with side length **s**, the circumradius **R** is given by:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{2 \\sin(\\pi/8)}\n\\]\n\nWe are given **s = 3**, so:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3}{2 \\sin(\\pi/8)}\n\\]\n\nWe’ll compute this numerically later if needed, but let’s hold off for now.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Understand the square\n\nWe are told that a **square is inscribed** such that:\n\n- One of its **vertices is at O1** (the center of the octagon).\n- Its **center is at point E**.\n\nThis is unusual — typically, a square inscribed in a regular octagon would have its vertices on the octagon’s vertices or midpoints of sides. But here, the square is defined by having **one vertex at the center** of the octagon, and its **center at point E**.\n\nThis implies the square is **not inscribed in the octagon** in the traditional sense, but rather placed such that:\n\n- O1 is a vertex of the square.\n- E is the center of the square.\n- The square is likely rotated and positioned so that its sides are aligned in some symmetric way relative to the octagon.\n\nAlso, points **H** and **O1** lie on segments of the combined figure, and we are to find **H–O1**.\n\nLooking at the diagram (even though we can’t see it, we can infer from labels), the points are labeled:\n\n- Octagon vertices: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H (probably in order).\n- Square vertices: D, E, F, K? Or maybe D, O1, H, something? Wait — the square has center E and vertex O1.\n\nWait — the diagram has points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, O1.\n\nFrom the diagram description:\n\n- The octagon is likely labeled A–H (8 vertices).\n- The square is likely D–E–F–K or something, but we are told **one vertex is O1**, and **center is E**.\n\nSo, if O1 is a vertex of the square, and E is the center, then the square must be positioned such that E is the midpoint of the diagonals.\n\nIn a square, the center is the midpoint of both diagonals. So if O1 is one vertex, then the opposite vertex (say, P) must satisfy:\n\n\\[\nE = \\text{midpoint of } O1 \\text{ and } P\n\\Rightarrow P = 2E - O1\n\\]\n\nBut we don’t have coordinates yet.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Assign coordinates to make this concrete\n\nLet’s place the octagon on the coordinate plane with center O1 at the origin: **O1 = (0, 0)**.\n\nAssume the regular octagon is oriented with a vertex on the positive x-axis.\n\nThe vertices of a regular octagon centered at origin with circumradius R are at angles:\n\n\\[\n\\theta_k = \\frac{2\\pi k}{8} = \\frac{\\pi k}{4}, \\quad k = 0, 1, 2, ..., 7\n\\]\n\nSo the 8 vertices are:\n\n\\[\nV_k = \\left( R \\cos\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{4}\\right), R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi k}{4}\\right) \\right)\n\\]\n\nLet’s label them starting from the rightmost vertex (k=0):\n\n- A: k=0 → (R, 0)\n- B: k=1 → (R cos(π/4), R sin(π/4)) = (R/√2, R/√2)\n- C: k=2 → (0, R)\n- D: k=3 → (-R/√2, R/√2)\n- E: k=4 → (-R, 0)\n- F: k=5 → (-R/√2, -R/√2)\n- G: k=6 → (0, -R)\n- H: k=7 → (R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nWait — but in the problem, **E is the center of the square**, not a vertex of the octagon? But in our labeling, E is a vertex of the octagon (at (-R, 0)).\n\nThis is a **conflict**.\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\n> A regular octagon with center O1 and side length 3 is given. A square is inscribed such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O1 of the octagon, and its center is at point E.\n\nSo **E is the center of the square**, and **O1 is a vertex of the square**.\n\nBut in the diagram, there is a point labeled E that is also a vertex of the octagon? Or is it a different point?\n\nThis is ambiguous without the diagram, but the key is: **E is the center of the square**, and **O1 is a vertex of the square**.\n\nSo perhaps the octagon’s vertices are labeled A–H, and E is not one of them — or maybe it is.\n\nWait — the diagram has points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, O1.\n\nFrom the connections:\n\n- The octagon is likely A–B–C–D–E–F–G–H–A.\n- The square is likely D–E–F–K or something, but we are told one vertex is O1.\n\nPerhaps the square is D–O1–H–something? But O1 is center of octagon.\n\nLet’s reinterpret.\n\nMaybe the square has vertices: **D, O1, H, and another point** — and its center is E.\n\nIf the square has vertices D, O1, H, and say, X, then E is the center.\n\nIn a square, the center is the average of the vertices.\n\nSo if D, O1, H, X are the vertices, then:\n\n\\[\nE = \\frac{D + O1 + H + X}{4}\n\\]\n\nBut we don’t know X.\n\nAlternatively, if O1 and H are adjacent vertices of the square, then the center E is the midpoint of the diagonal from O1 to the opposite vertex.\n\nWait — let’s think geometrically.\n\nSuppose the square has O1 as one vertex, and E as its center. Then the vector from O1 to E is half the diagonal vector.\n\nIn a square, the distance from a vertex to the center is \\(\\frac{\\text{side} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2}}\\).\n\nBut we don’t know the side of the square.\n\nHowever, we are told that the square is “inscribed” — but inscribed in what? Probably in the octagon, meaning its vertices lie on the octagon’s sides or vertices.\n\nGiven that O1 is the center of the octagon and also a vertex of the square, and E is the center of the square, and H is a point on the combined figure, and we need H–O1.\n\nLooking at the diagram labels, H is likely a vertex of the octagon.\n\nFrom our earlier labeling, if the octagon has vertices A–H, then H is at angle 7π/4, which is (R/√2, -R/√2).\n\nAnd O1 is at (0,0).\n\nSo if H is at (R/√2, -R/√2), then the distance H–O1 is just the distance from (0,0) to (R/√2, -R/√2), which is:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{ \\left(\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 + \\left(-\\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}}\\right)^2 } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{R^2}{2} + \\frac{R^2}{2} } = \\sqrt{R^2} = R\n\\]\n\nSo H–O1 = R, the circumradius of the octagon.\n\nBut is H a vertex of the octagon? In the diagram, yes, likely.\n\nAnd O1 is the center, so yes, H–O1 is just the radius.\n\nBut the problem mentions a square with vertex at O1 and center at E, and H is on the combined figure, and we need H–O1.\n\nIf H is a vertex of the octagon, then H–O1 = R, and we can compute R from side length 3.\n\nSo let’s compute R.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Compute circumradius R of regular octagon with side length 3\n\nFormula:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{2 \\sin(\\pi/8)}\n\\]\n\nWe know:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(\\pi/8) = \\sin(22.5^\\circ) = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1 - \\cos(45^\\circ)}{2} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{4} } = \\frac{ \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} }{2}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot \\frac{ \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} }{2} } = \\frac{3}{ \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} }\n\\]\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}\\):\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} }{ \\sqrt{ (2 - \\sqrt{2})(2 + \\sqrt{2}) } } = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} }{ \\sqrt{4 - 2} } = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} }{ \\sqrt{2} } = 3 \\cdot \\frac{ \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} }{ \\sqrt{2} } = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} } = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} }\n\\]\n\nAlternatively, leave it as:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]\n\nBut perhaps we can simplify numerically.\n\nCompute numerically:\n\nFirst, √2 ≈ 1.4142\n\nSo 2 - √2 ≈ 2 - 1.4142 = 0.5858\n\n√(0.5858) ≈ 0.7654\n\nSo R ≈ 3 / 0.7654 ≈ 3.919\n\nBut let’s see if there’s a better way.\n\nAlternatively, use the formula for circumradius of regular octagon:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} \n\\]\n\nWait, let me verify.\n\nActually, standard formula:\n\nFor a regular octagon, the circumradius R in terms of side length s is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{2 \\sin(\\pi/8)} = \\frac{s}{2} \\cdot \\csc(\\pi/8)\n\\]\n\nAnd \\(\\csc(\\pi/8) = \\frac{1}{\\sin(\\pi/8)} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\\), as above.\n\nThere is also a formula:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{2} \\left(1 + \\sqrt{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nWait, is that correct?\n\nLet me check with a unit octagon.\n\nActually, no — that’s for the distance from center to side (apothem) or something else.\n\nLet’s derive it.\n\nIn a regular octagon, you can divide it into 8 isosceles triangles with vertex angle 45°, and two sides R, base s.\n\nBy law of cosines:\n\n\\[\ns^2 = R^2 + R^2 - 2 R R \\cos(45^\\circ) = 2R^2 (1 - \\cos(45^\\circ)) = 2R^2 \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right) = 2R^2 \\cdot \\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{2} = R^2 (2 - \\sqrt{2})\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\ns^2 = R^2 (2 - \\sqrt{2}) \\Rightarrow R^2 = \\frac{s^2}{2 - \\sqrt{2}} \\Rightarrow R = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]\n\nAs before.\n\nSo for s=3:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]\n\nRationalize:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}\\):\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} }{ \\sqrt{ (2 - \\sqrt{2})(2 + \\sqrt{2}) } } = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} }{ \\sqrt{4 - 2} } = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} }{ \\sqrt{2} } = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} } = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} }\n\\]\n\nThis is exact, but perhaps we can leave it or compute numerically.\n\nBut the problem might expect an exact form or a simplified radical.\n\nNotice that:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut perhaps we can write R as:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} }{ \\sqrt{2} } = \\frac{3}{ \\sqrt{2} } \\cdot \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} }\n\\]\n\nStill messy.\n\nAlternatively, square it:\n\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{9}{2 - \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{9 (2 + \\sqrt{2})}{(2 - \\sqrt{2})(2 + \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{9 (2 + \\sqrt{2})}{4 - 2} = \\frac{9 (2 + \\sqrt{2})}{2} = \\frac{18 + 9\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 9 + \\frac{9\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n\\]\n\nBut we need R, not R^2.\n\nPerhaps the answer is simply R, and we box the expression.\n\nBut let’s think again.\n\nIs H–O1 really R?\n\nIn the diagram, if H is a vertex of the octagon, and O1 is the center, then yes, H–O1 = R.\n\nBut the problem mentions a square with vertex at O1 and center at E, and H is on the combined figure, and we need H–O1.\n\nPerhaps H is not a vertex of the octagon, but a vertex of the square.\n\nLet’s look at the diagram description: \"Points H and O1 lie on segments of the combined figure. Line segment H–O1 is drawn connecting these two points.\"\n\nAnd from the labels, in the diagram, H is likely a vertex of the octagon, as it's labeled with A–H.\n\nMoreover, in many such problems, H is the vertex at 315 degrees, so (R/√2, -R/√2), and O1 at (0,0), so distance is R.\n\nBut let’s consider the square.\n\nSuppose the square has O1 as a vertex, and E as its center.\n\nThen, the distance from O1 to E is half the diagonal of the square.\n\nIf the square has side length a, then diagonal is a√2, so O1 to E is (a√2)/2 = a/√2.\n\nBut we don't know a.\n\nHowever, the square is \"inscribed\" — probably meaning its other vertices lie on the octagon.\n\nPerhaps the square is rotated 45 degrees or something.\n\nAnother idea: in a regular octagon, if you connect every other vertex, you get a square.\n\nFor example, vertices A, C, E, G form a square.\n\nIn our labeling:\n\n- A: (R, 0)\n- C: (0, R)\n- E: (-R, 0)\n- G: (0, -R)\n\nThese form a square with side length R√2, and center at O1 (0,0).\n\nBut in this case, the center of the square is O1, not E.\n\nBut the problem says the center of the square is at E, and O1 is a vertex.\n\nSo this is not it.\n\nPerhaps the square is smaller.\n\nSuppose the square has vertices at, say, the midpoints of the octagon's sides.\n\nBut then O1 is not a vertex.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the square is positioned such that O1 is a vertex, and the square is inside the octagon, with its other vertices on the octagon's sides.\n\nBut this is getting complicated.\n\nLet’s look for symmetry.\n\nIn the diagram, from the labels, it seems that the square is D–E–F–K or something, but with O1 as a vertex.\n\nPerhaps the square is O1–D–H– something.\n\nAssume that the square has vertices O1, D, H, and another point.\n\nFrom our coordinate system:\n\n- O1: (0,0)\n- D: k=3: (-R/√2, R/√2)\n- H: k=7: (R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nLet’s see if O1, D, H can be three vertices of a square.\n\nVector O1 to D: (-R/√2, R/√2)\n\nVector O1 to H: (R/√2, -R/√2) = - ( -R/√2, R/√2) = - (O1 to D)\n\nSo H is in the opposite direction from D.\n\nSo O1, D, H are collinear? No, because D and H are not on the same line from O1.\n\nVector O1 to D: (-R/√2, R/√2)\n\nVector O1 to H: (R/√2, -R/√2) = -1 * ( -R/√2, R/√2) = - (O1 to D)\n\nSo yes, H is in the exact opposite direction from D, so O1, D, H are collinear, with O1 between D and H.\n\nDistance O1 to D: sqrt( (R/√2)^2 + (R/√2)^2 ) = sqrt( R^2/2 + R^2/2 ) = sqrt(R^2) = R\n\nSimilarly, O1 to H = R, and D to H = 2R.\n\nSo if O1, D, H are collinear, with O1 midpoint, then they can't be vertices of a square unless the square is degenerate.\n\nSo probably not.\n\nPerhaps the square is O1, D, and then two other points.\n\nLet’s assume that the square has O1 as a vertex, and is rotated 22.5 degrees or something.\n\nPerhaps E is the center, and in the diagram, E is at (-R, 0), which is vertex E of the octagon.\n\nIn our labeling, E is at (-R, 0).\n\nSo if E is the center of the square, and O1 is a vertex, then the vector from O1 to E is (-R, 0), so the distance O1 to E is R.\n\nIn a square, the distance from vertex to center is (side * √2)/2 = side / √2.\n\nSo if O1 to E = R, then side of square = R * √2.\n\nThen the square has side R√2.\n\nNow, if the square is centered at E = (-R, 0), and O1 = (0,0) is a vertex, then the square is positioned with O1 as a vertex, and center at E.\n\nThe vector from center to vertex is from E to O1: (0 - (-R), 0 - 0) = (R, 0)\n\nSo the vector from center to vertex is (R, 0), which is along the x-axis.\n\nIn a square, the vertices are at 45 degrees from the axes, so if one vertex is at (R,0) from center, then the square is aligned with the axes? No, because in a square, the vertices are at 45 degrees to the sides.\n\nIf the center is at E = (-R, 0), and one vertex is at O1 = (0,0), then the vector from center to vertex is (R, 0), so the square has a vertex on the positive x-axis from its center.\n\nThen the other vertices would be at 90, 180, 270 degrees from this vector.\n\nSo the vertices are at:\n\n- From center E: (R, 0), (0, R), (-R, 0), (0, -R) — but that's a diamond, not a square aligned with axes.\n\nWait, if the vector from center to vertex is (R,0), then for a square, the vertices are at angles 0°, 90°, 180°, 270° from the center, but that would make it a diamond if the square is axis-aligned, but in this case, if the vector is along x-axis, then the square has sides at 45 degrees.\n\nActually, for a square, if one vertex is at (a,0) from center, then the adjacent vertices are at (0,a), (-a,0), (0,-a) only if it's a diamond, but that's not a square with sides parallel to axes.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nSuppose center at E = (-R, 0)\n\nVertex at O1 = (0,0), so vector from E to O1 is (R, 0)\n\nFor a square, the next vertex would be obtained by rotating this vector by 90 degrees.\n\nRotate (R,0) by 90 degrees counterclockwise: (0, R)\n\nSo next vertex at E + (0,R) = (-R, 0) + (0,R) = (-R, R)\n\nSimilarly, rotate by 180: (-R,0) + (-R,0) = (-2R, 0)\n\nRotate by 270: (-R,0) + (0,-R) = (-R, -R)\n\nSo the four vertices are:\n\n- O1: (0,0)\n- P2: (-R, R)\n- P3: (-2R, 0)\n- P4: (-R, -R)\n\nNow, are these on the octagon?\n\nThe octagon has vertices at distance R from O1.\n\nLet's check distance from O1 to P2: (-R, R) to (0,0): sqrt(R^2 + R^2) = R√2 > R, so outside the octagon.\n\nSimilarly, P3: (-2R,0) to (0,0): 2R > R.\n\nSo not on the octagon.\n\nBut the problem says the square is \"inscribed\", so probably its vertices lie on the octagon.\n\nPerhaps the square is smaller.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"inscribed\" means that the square is inside the octagon and its vertices touch the octagon's sides, not necessarily vertices.\n\nBut this is vague.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, the square is D–E–F–K, and O1 is not a vertex of the square, but the problem says \"one of its vertices coincides with the center O1\".\n\nLet's read the problem again: \"A square is inscribed such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O1 of the octagon, and its center is at point E.\"\n\nSo O1 is a vertex of the square, E is the center of the square.\n\nIn the diagram, E is likely a point on the octagon or inside.\n\nFrom the labels, in the diagram, there is a point E that is also a vertex of the octagon, at (-R, 0).\n\nSo assume E = (-R, 0), O1 = (0,0).\n\nThen distance O1 to E = R.\n\nAs above, if E is center of square, O1 is vertex, then the side of the square is R * √2, as distance from vertex to center is (side * √2)/2 = side / √2, so side = R * √2.\n\nThen the square has vertices at E + vectors: (R,0), (0,R), (-R,0), (0,-R) relative to E, so absolute:\n\n- O1: (0,0) = E + (R,0)\n- P2: E + (0,R) = (-R, R)\n- P3: E + (-R,0) = (-2R, 0)\n- P4: E + (0,-R) = (-R, -R)\n\nNow, the octagon has vertices at distance R from O1, so for example, vertex D: (-R/√2, R/√2) ≈ (-0.707R, 0.707R)\n\nP2: (-R, R) = (-1R, 1R), distance from O1: sqrt(R^2 + R^2) = R√2 ≈ 1.414R > R, so outside.\n\nSo not on the octagon.\n\nPerhaps the square is oriented differently.\n\nMaybe the square is not with sides parallel to the axes.\n\nSuppose the square has O1 as vertex, E as center, and is rotated.\n\nBut then we need to know the orientation.\n\nPerhaps from the diagram, H is the vertex of the square that is adjacent to O1.\n\nIn a square, from a vertex, the adjacent vertices are at 90 degrees.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard.\n\nLet’s look for a different approach.\n\nPerhaps \"H–O1\" is not the radius, but a different segment.\n\nIn the diagram, H is likely the vertex at (R/√2, -R/√2), and O1 at (0,0), so distance is R, as before.\n\nAnd the square is separate, but the segment H–O1 is just the radius.\n\nAnd the square is red herring or for context.\n\nBut the problem says \"Points H and O1 lie on segments of the combined figure\", and \"line segment H–O1 is drawn\", so perhaps H is not a vertex of the octagon, but of the square.\n\nAssume that H is a vertex of the square.\n\nThe square has vertices: let's say O1, H, and two others, with center E.\n\nThen, in a square, the distance from O1 to H could be the side or the diagonal.\n\nIf O1 and H are adjacent vertices, then distance = side.\n\nIf opposite, then diagonal.\n\nBut we don't know.\n\nPerhaps from the diagram, H is the vertex of the square that is not O1, and E is center, so O1 to E is half the diagonal, and H to E is also half the diagonal, and O1 to H is the side or diagonal.\n\nIn a square, if O1 and H are adjacent, then O1 to H = side, O1 to E = (side * √2)/2 = side / √2, so O1 to H = (O1 to E) * √2.\n\nIf O1 and H are opposite, then O1 to H = diagonal = 2 * (O1 to E).\n\nBut we don't know O1 to E.\n\nUnless E is given.\n\nIn the diagram, E is likely at (-R, 0), as before.\n\nSo O1 to E = R.\n\nThen if O1 and H are adjacent vertices of the square, then O1 to H = R * √2.\n\nIf opposite, then 2R.\n\nBut 2R is larger than the octagon's diameter, which is 2R, so possible.\n\nBut let's see what makes sense.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, H is the vertex of the square that is at (-R, -R) or something.\n\nBut let's calculate the distance from O1 to H if H is at (R/√2, -R/√2) = (0.707R, -0.707R), then distance = R, as before.\n\nAnd this is a vertex of the octagon.\n\nMoreover, in many such problems, the answer is the circumradius.\n\nPerhaps the square is there to distract, or to define E, but H–O1 is simply the radius.\n\nAnd the answer is R = 3 / sqrt(2 - sqrt(2)) \n\nLet's simplify this expression.\n\nAs before:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} = 3 \\cdot \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} } = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \n\\]\n\nRationalize:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3 \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} } = 3 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} }\n\\]\n\nOr leave as:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3 \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} }\n\\]\n\nThis is as simplified as it gets.\n\nWe can write it as:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} \n\\]\n\nLet me check:\n\nFrom earlier, s^2 = R^2 (2 - \\sqrt{2}) , so R^2 = s^2 / (2 - \\sqrt{2}) = 9 / (2 - \\sqrt{2}) = 9(2 + \\sqrt{2})/2 = (18 + 9\\sqrt{2})/2 = 9 + (9\\sqrt{2})/2\n\nThen R = sqrt(9 + 9\\sqrt{2}/2) = 3 sqrt(1 + \\sqrt{2}/2) , same as before.\n\nPerhaps the problem expects a numerical answer, but it's not specified.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps \"H–O1\" is not the radius, but the distance from H to O1 where H is a point on the square.\n\nBut in the diagram, H is likely a vertex of the octagon.\n\nPerhaps the square is inscribed in the octagon in the sense that its vertices are on the octagon's vertices, but with O1 as a vertex, which is impossible since O1 is center.\n\nUnless \"inscribed\" means something else.\n\nPerhaps \" the square is inscribed\" means that the octagon is inscribed in the square, but the problem says \"a square is inscribed\" in the octagon.\n\nI think the most reasonable assumption is that H is a vertex of the octagon, and O1 is the center, so H–O1 = R = 3 / sin(π/8) / 2, but wait, R = s / (2 sin(π/8)) = 3 / (2 * sin(22.5°)) \n\nAnd sin(22.5°) = sqrt((1 - cos(45°))/2) = sqrt((1 - √2/2)/2) = sqrt((2-√2)/4) = sqrt(2-√2)/2\n\nSo R = 3 / (2 * sqrt(2-√2)/2) = 3 / sqrt(2-√2) \n\nNow, to box the answer, perhaps leave it as \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} or rationalize.\n\nLet's rationalize it:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{(2 - \\sqrt{2})(2 + \\sqrt{2})}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{4 - 2}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 3 \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} } = 3 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} }\n\\]\n\nOr:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2}} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = 3 \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} }\n\\]\n\nI think this is as good as it gets.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} / \\sqrt{2} , but let's see if it can be written as a single radical.\n\nNotice that \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} = 1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} , so R = 3 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} }\n\nBut perhaps in the context, they want the numerical value, but the problem doesn't specify.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"H–O1\" is the distance from H to O1, and in the diagram, H is not a vertex, but the point where the square and octagon intersect or something.\n\nPerhaps from the square's perspective.\n\nLet's assume that the square has O1 as vertex, E as center, and H is the vertex of the square that is adjacent to O1.\n\nThen, as above, if O1 to E = d, then O1 to H = d * √2, since in a square, from vertex to center is d, to adjacent vertex is d * √2? No.\n\nIn a square, from a vertex to the center is (s * √2)/2 = s/√2.\n\nFrom a vertex to an adjacent vertex is s.\n\nSo if O1 to E = s/√2, then O1 to H = s = (O1 to E) * √2.\n\nSo if we can find O1 to E, then multiply by √2.\n\nBut what is O1 to E?\n\nIn the diagram, E is likely at (-R, 0), so O1 to E = R.\n\nThen O1 to H = R * √2.\n\nBut R = 3 / sqrt(2 - sqrt(2)) , so O1 to H = 3 * sqrt(2) / sqrt(2 - sqrt(2)) = 3 * sqrt(2 / (2 - sqrt(2)) ) \n\nSimplify 2 / (2 - sqrt(2)) = 2(2 + sqrt(2)) / ((2 - sqrt(2))(2 + sqrt(2)) ) = 2(2 + sqrt(2)) / (4 - 2) = 2(2 + sqrt(2)) / 2 = 2 + sqrt(2)\n\nSo O1 to H = 3 * sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)) \n\nOh! So if H is an adjacent vertex of the square, then H–O1 = 3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} \n\nAnd this is a nice expression.\n\nMoreover, in the diagram, if the square is positioned with O1 at (0,0), E at (-R,0), then the adjacent vertex H could be at E + rotate (R,0) by 90 degrees = (-R,0) + (0,R) = (-R, R) , but then distance from O1 to H is sqrt(R^2 + R^2) = R√2, and R = 3 / sqrt(2 - sqrt(2)) , so R√2 = 3 sqrt(2) / sqrt(2 - sqrt(2)) = 3 sqrt(2 / (2 - sqrt(2)) ) = 3 sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)) as above.\n\nAnd this is a clean expression.\n\nPerhaps this is the intended answer.\n\nMoreover, in the diagram, H might be at (-R, R), which is not a vertex of the octagon, but a vertex of the square, and the problem says \"points H and O1 lie on segments of the combined figure\", which is true.\n\nSo likely, H is a vertex of the square, not of the octagon.\n\nAnd the length H–O1 = 3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} \n\nLet me verify the units.\n\nSide length of octagon is 3, so this should be reasonable.\n\nNumerically, sqrt(2) ≈ 1.414, so 2 + sqrt(2) ≈ 3.414, sqrt(3.414) ≈ 1.847, times 3 ≈ 5.54, while the circumradius R ≈ 3.919, so 5.54 > R, which makes sense if H is outside the octagon.\n\nIn the diagram, the square may extend outside the octagon, or perhaps not, but the problem doesn't say it's inscribed in the octagon in the sense of being inside.\n\nThe problem says \"a square is inscribed\" — but inscribed in what? It doesn't specify, but probably in the octagon, but with O1 as vertex, it must extend outside.\n\nPerhaps \"inscribed\" means that the square is drawn within the octagon, but with O1 as vertex, it's impossible unless the square is small.\n\nPerhaps the square is inscribed in the octagon by having its vertices on the octagon's sides.\n\nBut then O1 is center, not on the boundary.\n\nI think the most plausible is that H is a vertex of the square, and H–O1 = 3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} \n\nAnd this is a nice exact form.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nSo the length of segment H–O1 is \\boxed{3\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}} \n\nTo confirm, let's see if this makes sense.\n\nFrom earlier, if the square has center E, and O1 is a vertex, and if E is at distance R from O1, and R = 3 / sqrt(2 - sqrt(2)) , then side of square s = R * sqrt(2) = 3 sqrt(2) / sqrt(2 - sqrt(2)) = 3 sqrt(2 / (2 - sqrt(2)) ) = 3 sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)) as above.\n\nAnd if H is an adjacent vertex, then H–O1 = s = 3 sqrt(2 + sqrt(2)) \n\nYes.\n\nSo the answer is \\boxed{3\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}"
