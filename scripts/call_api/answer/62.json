    "Two circles, one centered at O1 and the other at O2, are shown tangent externally at point A. The circle centered at O1 has a radius of 5 units. The circle centered at O2 is obtained by translating the first circle vertically downward. Calculate the circumference of the circle centered at O2."

  "answer": [
    "We are given:\n\n- Two circles, one centered at O1 and the other at O2.\n- They are **externally tangent** at point A.\n- The circle centered at O1 has **radius 5 units**.\n- The circle centered at O2 is obtained by **translating the first circle vertically downward**.\n\nWe are to **calculate the circumference of the circle centered at O2**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand what “translating the first circle vertically downward” means\n\nTranslation is a rigid transformation — it moves every point of a figure by the same distance in the same direction, **without changing size or shape**.\n\nSo, if the circle centered at O2 is obtained by translating the circle centered at O1 vertically downward, then:\n\n→ The **radius of the circle at O2 is the same** as the radius of the circle at O1.\n\nThat is, **radius of circle O2 = 5 units**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm with the tangency condition\n\nThe two circles are externally tangent at point A.\n\nFor two circles to be externally tangent, the **distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii**.\n\nLet:\n\n- r1 = radius of circle O1 = 5\n- r2 = radius of circle O2 = ?\n\nThen, distance between O1 and O2 = r1 + r2.\n\nBut we are told that circle O2 is a **translation** of circle O1 — meaning same size, so r2 = r1 = 5.\n\nTherefore, distance between O1 and O2 = 5 + 5 = 10 units.\n\nThis is consistent with the diagram: since the circles are tangent externally and one is directly below the other (vertical translation), the centers are aligned vertically, and the distance between them is 10, which equals the sum of the radii — so everything checks out.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute the circumference of circle O2\n\nCircumference of a circle is given by:\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nWe have r = 5 for circle O2.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi \\cdot 5 = 10\\pi\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10\\pi}\n\\]"
