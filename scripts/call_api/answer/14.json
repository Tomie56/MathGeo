    "We are given a geometric construction involving a **regular octagon** centered at point **O1**, with side length 3. A **square** is inscribed in the **circumcircle** of the octagon, centered at point **E** (which may or may not be the same as O1 — we’ll check), and two of its vertices, **I** and **K**, lie on the circumcircle. We are to find the **radian measure of angle ∠I-O1-K**, i.e., the angle at the center O1 between points I and K.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the regular octagon\n\nA **regular octagon** has 8 equal sides and 8 equal central angles. The central angle between two adjacent vertices is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nSo, if we label the vertices of the octagon as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H (in order), then the angle between any two adjacent vertices as seen from the center O1 is π/4.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand the square inscribed in the circumcircle\n\nThe square is inscribed in the **same circumcircle** as the octagon. That means all four vertices of the square lie on the circle that passes through all eight vertices of the octagon.\n\nSince the square is inscribed in the circle, its vertices are spaced equally around the circle — every 90°, or π/2 radians.\n\nSo, if we pick one vertex of the square, say I, then the next vertex (going around the circle) will be at an angle of π/2 from I, and so on.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine positions of I and K\n\nWe are told that **I** and **K** are two vertices of the square, both lying on the circumcircle. Since it’s a square, the angular separation between adjacent vertices is π/2. But the problem doesn’t specify whether I and K are adjacent or opposite.\n\nHowever, note that the angle we are to find is **∠I-O1-K**, the angle at the center between points I and K.\n\nIn a square inscribed in a circle, the angle between two **adjacent** vertices (as seen from the center) is π/2, and the angle between two **opposite** vertices is π.\n\nBut in the diagram (even though we can’t see it, we can infer from the labels and the description), points I and K are likely **not adjacent** — because if they were, the angle would be π/2, and the problem would be trivial. Also, the square is centered at point E, and O1 is the center of the octagon — if E and O1 are the same point (which is likely, since both are centers of figures sharing the same circumcircle), then the square is centered at O1.\n\nWait — the problem says: “a square centered at point E is derived such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon.” And then: “Point O1 is the center of the octagon and also lies on the line segment connecting H (a vertex of the octagon) and O1...” — that last part is redundant or typo? Probably meant to say “lies on the line segment connecting H and some other point”, but as written, it says “H and O1”, which is trivial.\n\nBut crucially, if the square is inscribed in the same circle as the octagon, and centered at E, and O1 is the center of the octagon, then **E and O1 must be the same point**, because a circle has only one center. So we can safely assume that **E = O1**.\n\nTherefore, the square is centered at O1, inscribed in the circumcircle of the octagon.\n\nSo, the square’s vertices are spaced every π/2 radians around the circle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Determine the angular separation between I and K\n\nThe problem doesn’t specify which vertices I and K are, but since the square has 4 vertices, and they are spaced every π/2, the possible angular separations between any two vertices (as seen from the center) are:\n\n- π/2 (adjacent vertices)\n- π (opposite vertices)\n\nBut in a square, there are only two distinct angular separations: π/2 and π.\n\nNow, the problem says: “Point I is a vertex of the square, and point K is another vertex of the square, positioned such that both I and K lie on the circumcircle of the octagon.” — which they all do, by construction.\n\nBut we need to find ∠I-O1-K.\n\nIf I and K are adjacent, angle = π/2.\n\nIf I and K are opposite, angle = π.\n\nBut which is it?\n\nLet’s look at the diagram description: points are labeled I, J, K, L for the square? Wait, in the diagram, we see points I, J, K, and also D, E, F, G, H, A, B, C — which are likely the octagon’s vertices.\n\nIn the diagram, we see:\n\n- Octagon vertices: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H (in order)\n- Square vertices: I, J, K, and one more? (probably L, but not labeled in the text)\n\nFrom the diagram’s connectivity:\n\n- I is connected to D and J\n- J is connected to I and K\n- K is connected to J and F\n- F is connected to K and E\n- E is connected to F and D? Wait, not clear.\n\nBut more importantly, the square is I-J-K-? and back to I.\n\nAssuming the square is I-J-K-L, and from the connections, I to J to K, so I and K are **not adjacent** — they are separated by one vertex (J), so they are **opposite** vertices of the square.\n\nIn a square, if you go from one vertex to the next, that’s 90°, then to the next is another 90°, so from I to K is 180°, i.e., π radians.\n\nTherefore, the angle ∠I-O1-K is the angle between two opposite vertices of the square, as seen from the center — which is **π radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Confirm with octagon symmetry\n\nThe octagon has 8 vertices, spaced every π/4 radians.\n\nThe square’s vertices must lie on the same circle, so they must coincide with some of the octagon’s vertices? Not necessarily — the square can be rotated relative to the octagon.\n\nBut in a regular octagon, the circumcircle has points every π/4 radians. A square inscribed in the same circle must have its vertices at angles that are multiples of π/2. So, for example, if one vertex of the square is at angle 0, the others are at π/2, π, 3π/2.\n\nBut the octagon’s vertices are at angles: 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4.\n\nSo the square’s vertices can be placed at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2 — which are also vertices of the octagon! Specifically, if the octagon has vertices at those angles, then the square’s vertices coincide with every other vertex of the octagon.\n\nIn that case, I and K could be at 0 and π, so angle between them is π.\n\nAlternatively, if the square is rotated by π/8, then its vertices are at π/8, 5π/8, 9π/8, 13π/8 — which are not octagon vertices, but still on the circle.\n\nBut the problem says: “Point I is a vertex of the square, and point K is another vertex of the square, positioned such that both I and K lie on the circumcircle of the octagon.” — which they always do, since the square is inscribed in that circle.\n\nBut in the diagram, we see that I is connected to D and J, and K is connected to J and F. Also, D and F are octagon vertices.\n\nAssuming the octagon is labeled consecutively: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\nIf D and F are two vertices of the octagon, and they are separated by one vertex (E), then the angle between D and F at the center is 2 * (π/4) = π/2.\n\nBut I is connected to D, and K is connected to F. If I and K are vertices of the square, and D and F are octagon vertices, perhaps I and K are not the same as D and F.\n\nBut regardless, the key is: in a square inscribed in a circle, the angle between two vertices at the center is either π/2 or π.\n\nAnd since I and K are not adjacent (as per the diagram connectivity: I-J-K, so I and K are separated by J), they must be opposite vertices, so angle is π.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\pi}\n\\]"
