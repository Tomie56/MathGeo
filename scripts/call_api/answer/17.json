    "We are given a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3, oriented at 0 radians (i.e., one vertex lies along the positive x-axis). A square is constructed with center E such that its vertices lie on the **circumcircle** of the octagon. Point I and point K are two non-adjacent vertices of this square. We are to find the angle ∠IO1K in radians, expressed as a multiple of π.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\n- The octagon is **regular** and centered at O1. So all its vertices lie on a circle (the circumcircle) centered at O1.\n- The square is constructed so that **its vertices lie on the same circumcircle** as the octagon. That is, the square is inscribed in the same circle as the octagon.\n- The square has center E. Since the square is inscribed in the circle centered at O1, and the square’s vertices lie on that circle, then the center of the square must also be O1 — **unless** the square is rotated or shifted. But the problem says “center E”, so perhaps E is not O1?\n\nWait — let’s read carefully:\n\n> “A square is constructed with center E such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon”\n\nSo the square is inscribed in the circumcircle of the octagon, but its center is E. For a square inscribed in a circle, the center of the square **must coincide** with the center of the circle — because the diagonals of the square are diameters of the circle, and they intersect at the center.\n\nTherefore, **E must be O1**.\n\nBut the problem says “center E”, and then later refers to points I, K, and angle ∠IO1K — so O1 is still the center of the octagon, and we’re to find the angle at O1 between points I and K, which are vertices of the square.\n\nSo if the square is inscribed in the circle centered at O1, then E = O1. So perhaps “center E” is just a red herring, or perhaps E is a typo? But let’s assume E = O1 for now, because otherwise the square cannot have its vertices on the circumcircle of the octagon unless its center is also O1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is not centered at O1? But if its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon, and the octagon is centered at O1, then the circle is centered at O1. For a square to have all four vertices on a circle, the center of the square must be the center of the circle. So E = O1.\n\nTherefore, we can proceed assuming E = O1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine positions of square vertices on the circle\n\nThe octagon is regular, so its vertices are spaced at angles of 2π/8 = π/4 radians apart.\n\nLet’s assume the octagon is oriented so that one vertex is at angle 0 (along the positive x-axis). So the vertices of the octagon are at angles:\n\n0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4.\n\nNow, we construct a square whose vertices lie on the same circle. Since the square has 4 vertices, they must be spaced at 2π/4 = π/2 radians apart.\n\nBut which 4 points? The problem doesn’t specify the orientation of the square. However, it says “vertex-on-center derivation” — this phrase is not standard, but perhaps it means that the square is derived by placing its vertices at positions that are “on the center” — maybe meaning aligned with the octagon’s vertices?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square is rotated relative to the octagon.\n\nBut since the square is inscribed in the same circle, and we are to find angle ∠IO1K where I and K are non-adjacent vertices of the square, then I and K are **opposite vertices** of the square — because in a square, non-adjacent vertices are opposite (diagonally opposite).\n\nIn a square inscribed in a circle, the diagonals are diameters of the circle. So the angle ∠IO1K, where I and K are opposite vertices, is the angle subtended by a diameter at the center — which is **π radians**.\n\nWait — that would be true if I and K are endpoints of a diameter. But in a square inscribed in a circle, the diagonals are diameters, so yes — any two opposite vertices are endpoints of a diameter.\n\nTherefore, the angle ∠IO1K is the angle at the center between two points that are endpoints of a diameter — which is π radians.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward. Let me check the problem again.\n\n> “Point I is a vertex of the square, and point K is another vertex of the square such that I and K are not adjacent.”\n\nIn a square, each vertex has two adjacent vertices and one opposite vertex. So “not adjacent” means they are opposite. So yes, I and K are endpoints of a diagonal — so O1I and O1K are radii in opposite directions — so angle between them is π.\n\nBut then why mention the octagon? Why give side length 3? Why mention orientation?\n\nPerhaps I misinterpreted.\n\nWait — the square is constructed with center E, and E may not be O1? But earlier logic says it must be.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the square is not inscribed in the circumcircle of the octagon in the way I think.\n\nLet me re-read:\n\n> “A square is constructed with center E such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon”\n\nSo the square’s vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon — which is centered at O1. So the square is inscribed in that circle. Therefore, its center must be O1. So E = O1.\n\nThen I and K are non-adjacent vertices of the square — so they are opposite — so angle at O1 is π.\n\nBut that seems too simple, and the octagon’s side length is given — 3 — which is not used. Also, the orientation is given — 0 radians — which suggests that the position matters.\n\nPerhaps the square is not aligned with the octagon’s vertices? But still, if it's inscribed in the circle, and I and K are opposite, angle is π.\n\nUnless... “not adjacent” does not mean opposite? In a square, there are only 4 vertices. Each vertex has two adjacent and one opposite. So “not adjacent” must mean opposite.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that the square is not inscribed in the circle in the usual way? Or perhaps “vertex-on-center derivation” means something else.\n\nLet me look at the diagram description. The user provided a diagram with points labeled A through K and O1, and lines connecting them.\n\nFrom the diagram description:\n\n- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, O1\n- Lines: O1 connected to D, C, B, A, H, G, F, E, I, J, K? Not clear.\n\nBut from the text: “Line segments O1I and O1K are drawn, forming angle ∠IO1K at the center O1.”\n\nAnd I and K are vertices of the square, not adjacent.\n\nBut in the diagram, there is also point E, which is the center of the square.\n\nPerhaps E is not O1? But how can a square have its vertices on a circle centered at O1, but have its own center E ≠ O1? That’s impossible unless the circle is not centered at O1, but the octagon is centered at O1, and the circumcircle is centered at O1.\n\nUnless the square is not inscribed in the circumcircle of the octagon, but rather its vertices lie on it — which is the same thing.\n\nI think there's a mistake in my assumption.\n\nLet me consider: perhaps the square is constructed such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle, but it is rotated relative to the octagon, and E is the center of the square, which is not O1? But that's geometrically impossible for a square inscribed in a circle.\n\nUnless the circle is not the circumcircle of the octagon? But the problem says “the circumcircle of the octagon”.\n\nPerhaps “vertex-on-center derivation” means that the square is derived by placing its vertices at the centers of the octagon's sides or something? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother interpretation: perhaps \"vertex-on-center\" means that the square's vertices are placed at the centers of the octagon's vertices? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps it's a translation issue or a misphrasing.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose the octagon is regular, centered at O1, with side length 3. The circumradius R of a regular octagon with side length s is given by:\n\nR = s / (2 * sin(π/8))\n\nSo R = 3 / (2 * sin(π/8))\n\nBut we may not need the actual radius, since we're dealing with angles.\n\nNow, the square is inscribed in this circle, so its vertices are on the circle. The angle between two adjacent vertices of the square, as seen from the center, is 2π/4 = π/2.\n\nThe angle between two opposite vertices is π.\n\nBut the problem asks for angle ∠IO1K, with I and K not adjacent — so opposite — so π.\n\nBut why is the octagon mentioned? Perhaps to indicate that the square is not aligned with the octagon's vertices, but still, the angle is π.\n\nUnless \"not adjacent\" means something else. In a square, if you take two vertices that are not adjacent, they are opposite, so angle is π.\n\nPerhaps the square is not inscribed in the circle in the way I think. Maybe only some vertices are on the circle, but the problem says \"its vertices lie on the circumcircle\", so all four.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"center E\" is not O1, and the square is not centered at O1, but its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon. Is that possible?\n\nFor example, can you have a square whose vertices lie on a circle, but the square's center is not the circle's center? No, because in a circle, if you have a square inscribed, the diagonals are diameters, and they intersect at the center, so the center of the square must be the center of the circle.\n\nSo E must be O1.\n\nTherefore, I think the answer is π.\n\nBut let's look at the diagram description again. The user has points labeled, and from the text, it seems that there is a square with vertices I, J, K, and another point, and O1 is the center of the octagon, and E is the center of the square.\n\nIn the diagram, there is a line from O1 to I, O1 to K, and also O1 to D, C, etc.\n\nPerhaps from the diagram, we can infer the positions.\n\nSince I don't have the actual diagram, I need to assume.\n\nPerhaps the square is rotated by 22.5 degrees or something relative to the octagon.\n\nBut still, if I and K are opposite vertices, the angle at O1 is π.\n\nUnless \"not adjacent\" means not sharing a side, but in a square, that's only the opposite vertex.\n\nPerhaps in the context, \"not adjacent\" means not next to each other in the octagon's vertex order, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the square is not inscribed in the circumcircle, but rather, its vertices are at the centers of the octagon's sides or something. But the problem says \"vertices lie on the circumcircle\".\n\nLet's read the problem once more:\n\n> \"Consider a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3, oriented at 0 radians. A square is constructed with center E such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon (i.e., vertex-on-center derivation). Point I is a vertex of the square, and point K is another vertex of the square such that I and K are not adjacent. Line segments O1I and O1K are drawn, forming angle ∠IO1K at the center O1.\"\n\nThe phrase \"vertex-on-center derivation\" is in parentheses, so it's explaining \"such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle\". Perhaps \"vertex-on-center\" means that the square's vertices are placed at the centers of the octagon's vertices? But that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps \"vertex-on-center\" is a mistranslation, and it means that the square is derived by connecting every other vertex of the octagon or something.\n\nIn a regular octagon, if you connect every other vertex, you get a square.\n\nFor example, in a regular octagon with vertices at angles 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4, if you take vertices at 0, π/2, π, 3π/2, you get a square.\n\nOr at π/4, 3π/4, 5π/4, 7π/4, you get another square.\n\nSo perhaps the square is formed by selecting 4 vertices of the octagon that form a square.\n\nIn that case, the square's vertices are also vertices of the octagon, so they lie on the circumcircle, and the center of the square is O1.\n\nThen, if I and K are not adjacent vertices of the square, they are opposite, so angle is π.\n\nBut again, same result.\n\nPerhaps \"not adjacent\" means not adjacent in the octagon, but in the square, they might be adjacent or not.\n\nBut the problem says \"I and K are not adjacent\" — and since they are vertices of the square, it should mean not adjacent in the square.\n\nSo I think the answer is π.\n\nBut let's consider if the square is rotated. Suppose the square is inscribed in the circle, but rotated by an angle θ. Then the vertices are at θ, θ+π/2, θ+π, θ+3π/2.\n\nThen I and K are at θ and θ+π, so the angle between them is π.\n\nAlways π.\n\nSo regardless of orientation, if I and K are opposite vertices of the square, the angle at the center is π.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be π.\n\nBut why is the side length given? Perhaps to distract, or perhaps for a different interpretation.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps \"vertex-on-center derivation\" means that the square is constructed by placing its vertices at the centers of the octagon's sides, but then those points may not lie on the circumcircle.\n\nLet's calculate.\n\nIn a regular octagon with side length s, the distance from center to a side (apothem) is R * cos(π/8), where R is circumradius.\n\nThe circumradius R = s / (2 * sin(π/8))\n\nThe apothem a = R * cos(π/8) = s * cos(π/8) / (2 * sin(π/8)) = (s/2) * cot(π/8)\n\nThe distance from center to a vertex is R, to a side is a < R, so if you place vertices of the square at the midpoints of the octagon's sides, they are not on the circumcircle.\n\nSo that can't be.\n\nPerhaps \"vertex-on-center\" means that the square's vertices are at the octagon's vertices, and \"center\" refers to O1.\n\nI think I have to conclude that the angle is π.\n\nBut let's think about the diagram. The user has points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, O1.\n\nFrom the description, O1 is connected to D, C, B, A, H, G, F, E, I, J, K — so many points.\n\nPerhaps the square is I, J, K, and another point, and E is its center, and O1 is the octagon's center, and they are different.\n\nBut how can that be?\n\nUnless the square is not inscribed in the circumcircle, but the problem says \"its vertices lie on the circumcircle\".\n\nPerhaps \"circumcircle of the octagon\" is misinterpreted. The circumcircle is the circle passing through all vertices of the octagon, centered at O1.\n\nFor a square to have its vertices on that circle, its center must be O1.\n\nSo I think the only logical conclusion is that ∠IO1K = π.\n\nPerhaps \"not adjacent\" means something else. In some contexts, \"adjacent\" might mean sharing a side in the octagon, but the problem says \"I and K are not adjacent\" and they are vertices of the square, so it should be in the context of the square.\n\nPerhaps in the square, I and K are not adjacent, but in the octagon's vertex set, they are not adjacent, but that doesn't change the angle.\n\nI recall that in a regular octagon, if you take every second vertex, you get a square, and the angle between opposite vertices is π.\n\nFor example, vertices at 0 and π, angle is π.\n\nOr at π/4 and 5π/4, angle is π.\n\nAlways π.\n\nSo I think the answer is π.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that I and K are not opposite, but the problem says \"not adjacent\", and in a square, that means opposite.\n\nUnless the square has more than 4 vertices, but it doesn't.\n\nI think I have to go with π.\n\nSo the radian measure is π.\n\nExpressed as a multiple of π, it is 1 * π.\n\nSo \\boxed{\\pi}\n\nBut let's double-check with a different interpretation.\n\nSuppose that \"vertex-on-center derivation\" means that the square is constructed by placing its vertices at the centers of the octagon's vertices, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nPerhaps \"center\" refers to the center of the octagon's sides.\n\nAnother idea: in some geometries, \"vertex-on-center\" might mean that the square's vertices are at the points where the octagon's diagonals intersect or something, but that's complicated.\n\nPerhaps the square is inscribed in the octagon, not in the circumcircle.\n\nBut the problem says \"lie on the circumcircle\".\n\nI think I'm overcomplicating.\n\nLet me calculate the angle if the square is rotated.\n\nSuppose the square has vertices at angles θ, θ+π/2, θ+π, θ+3π/2.\n\nThen I at θ, K at θ+π, so vector O1I and O1K are in directions θ and θ+π, so the angle between them is π.\n\nAlways.\n\nSo regardless of θ, the angle is π.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{\\pi}.\n\nI think that's it."
