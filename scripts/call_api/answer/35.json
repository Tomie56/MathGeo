    "We are given a regular hexagon with center O₁ and side length 5. A smaller, concentric, scaled-down hexagon (by factor 1/2) is inscribed inside it — but we are not directly asked about that smaller hexagon. Instead, we are to find the length of segment M₀M₁, where:\n\n- M₀ is the midpoint of side AB of the **outer** hexagon.\n- M₁ is the midpoint of side FA of the **outer** hexagon.\n\nSo we are working entirely with the **outer** hexagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry of a regular hexagon\n\nA regular hexagon can be divided into 6 equilateral triangles, each with side length equal to the side of the hexagon (here, 5). The center O₁ is equidistant from all vertices.\n\nLabel the vertices of the outer hexagon in order: A, B, C, D, E, F, going counterclockwise.\n\nSo the sides are: AB, BC, CD, DE, EF, FA.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- M₀ is the midpoint of AB.\n- M₁ is the midpoint of FA.\n\nWe need to find the distance between M₀ and M₁.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Place the hexagon on the coordinate plane\n\nTo compute distances, we can place the hexagon on the coordinate plane with center O₁ at the origin (0,0).\n\nIn a regular hexagon, the vertices can be placed at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, 180°, 240°, 300°, each at distance equal to the side length (5) from the center.\n\nSo, let’s assign coordinates to the vertices:\n\nLet’s define vertex A at angle 0°, so:\n\n- A: (5, 0)\n- B: (5·cos(60°), 5·sin(60°)) = (5·0.5, 5·(√3/2)) = (2.5, (5√3)/2)\n- C: (5·cos(120°), 5·sin(120°)) = (5·(-0.5), 5·(√3/2)) = (-2.5, (5√3)/2)\n- D: (5·cos(180°), 5·sin(180°)) = (-5, 0)\n- E: (5·cos(240°), 5·sin(240°)) = (5·(-0.5), 5·(-√3/2)) = (-2.5, -(5√3)/2)\n- F: (5·cos(300°), 5·sin(300°)) = (5·0.5, 5·(-√3/2)) = (2.5, -(5√3)/2)\n\nLet’s verify: going from A to B to C... to F to A — yes, counterclockwise.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find coordinates of M₀ and M₁\n\nM₀ is the midpoint of AB.\n\nA = (5, 0), B = (2.5, (5√3)/2)\n\nMidpoint M₀ = average of coordinates:\n\nx-coordinate: (5 + 2.5)/2 = 7.5/2 = 3.75\n\ny-coordinate: (0 + (5√3)/2)/2 = (5√3)/4\n\nSo M₀ = (3.75, (5√3)/4)\n\n---\n\nM₁ is the midpoint of FA.\n\nF = (2.5, -(5√3)/2), A = (5, 0)\n\nMidpoint M₁ = average:\n\nx-coordinate: (2.5 + 5)/2 = 7.5/2 = 3.75\n\ny-coordinate: (-(5√3)/2 + 0)/2 = -(5√3)/4\n\nSo M₁ = (3.75, -(5√3)/4)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute distance between M₀ and M₁\n\nWe now have:\n\nM₀ = (3.75, (5√3)/4)\n\nM₁ = (3.75, -(5√3)/4)\n\nSame x-coordinate → vertical segment.\n\nDistance = difference in y-coordinates:\n\n| (5√3)/4 - (-(5√3)/4) | = | (5√3)/4 + (5√3)/4 | = | (10√3)/4 | = (5√3)/2\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\n$$\n\nThis is the length of segment M₀M₁."
