    "We are given a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3. A square is inscribed such that:\n\n- One of its vertices is at O1 (the center of the octagon).\n- The square is centered at point E.\n- The “radius” of the square (distance from center E to any vertex) equals the circumradius of the octagon.\n- Point E lies on a side of the octagon.\n- We are to find the length of segment O1E.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nWe have a regular octagon centered at O1. A square is inscribed such that:\n\n- One vertex of the square is at O1.\n- The square’s center is E.\n- The square’s “radius” (distance from E to any vertex) = circumradius of the octagon.\n- E lies on a side of the octagon.\n\nThis is a bit unusual — typically, a square inscribed in a circle has its vertices on the circle. Here, the square is defined such that its center is E, and its vertices lie on a circle of radius R (the circumradius of the octagon), and one of those vertices is O1.\n\nSo, the square has:\n\n- Center at E.\n- One vertex at O1.\n- All vertices lie on a circle centered at E with radius R (the circumradius of the octagon).\n\nTherefore, the distance from E to O1 is R — because O1 is a vertex of the square, and the square’s vertices lie on a circle of radius R centered at E.\n\nWait — that would mean O1E = R.\n\nBut then the problem says “point E lies on a side of the octagon”. So if O1E = R, and E is on a side of the octagon, then the distance from the center of the octagon to a point on its side is R? That can’t be — because the distance from center to a vertex is R (circumradius), and the distance from center to a side is the apothem, which is less than R.\n\nSo there’s a contradiction unless we reinterpret.\n\nWait — perhaps the square is not inscribed in the octagon, but rather inscribed in a circle of radius R (the circumradius of the octagon), and one of its vertices is placed at O1 (the center of the octagon). But then the center of the square E would be at distance R from O1 — again, O1E = R.\n\nBut then E is on a side of the octagon — so the distance from O1 to a point E on a side of the octagon is R? That would mean the apothem equals the circumradius — which is false for a regular octagon.\n\nSo something is wrong with this interpretation.\n\nLet’s reread the problem:\n\n> “A square centered at point E is inscribed such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O1 of the octagon, and its radius equals the circumradius of the octagon.”\n\nThe key is: the square is inscribed — inscribed where? Probably inscribed in a circle of radius equal to the circumradius of the octagon. So the square is inscribed in a circle of radius R, and one of its vertices is at O1. The center of the square is E. So E is the center of the circle in which the square is inscribed, so E is the center of the circle passing through all four vertices of the square, including O1. Therefore, the distance from E to O1 is R — the radius of that circle.\n\nBut then E lies on a side of the octagon. So we are to find the distance from O1 to E, where E is a point on a side of the octagon, and also |O1E| = R.\n\nBut in a regular octagon, the distance from center to a side (the apothem) is less than R. So if E is on a side, then |O1E| should be the apothem, not R.\n\nThis is a contradiction unless... perhaps the square is not inscribed in a circle centered at E? But the problem says “centered at point E” and “its radius equals the circumradius of the octagon”, so it must be that the square is inscribed in a circle of radius R centered at E, and O1 is one vertex of the square.\n\nSo |O1E| = R.\n\nBut then E is on a side of the octagon, so the distance from O1 to a point on a side is R. But in a regular octagon, the maximum distance from center to a point on a side is the distance to the midpoint of a side — the apothem — which is less than R.\n\nSo this is impossible unless the point E is not on the side of the octagon in the usual sense — perhaps on the extension? But the problem says “lies on a side of the octagon”.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps “inscribed” means something else — perhaps the square is inscribed in the octagon? But then its vertices would be on the octagon’s sides or vertices, and one vertex at O1 — which is inside, not on the boundary.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nLet me try to reinterpret.\n\nPerhaps the square is inscribed in the octagon, meaning its vertices lie on the octagon’s sides or vertices, and one vertex is at O1 — but O1 is the center, not on the boundary. So that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother possibility: the square is inscribed in a circle of radius R (circumradius of octagon), and this circle is centered at E, and one vertex of the square is at O1. So |O1E| = R. Additionally, E lies on a side of the octagon. So we need to find |O1E|, which is R, but also E is on a side of the octagon, so |O1E| must be the distance from center to a point on a side.\n\nBut in a regular octagon, the distance from center to a point on a side varies from the apothem (minimum, at midpoint) to the circumradius (at vertices). So if E is on a side, |O1E| can range from apothem to R. But if |O1E| = R, then E must be at a vertex of the octagon, not on a side (unless at a vertex, but vertices are not on the side, they are endpoints).\n\nThe problem says “lies on a side”, which typically means on the edge, not at a vertex.\n\nSo perhaps the only way this makes sense is if we assume that E is on the side, and |O1E| is to be found, and it is not necessarily R, but the square's radius is R, and O1 is a vertex of the square, so |O1E| = R.\n\nBut then E is on a side, so |O1E| = R, which implies that the distance from center to a point on a side is R, which only happens if that point is a vertex.\n\nSo perhaps \"lies on a side\" includes the vertices? In some contexts, \"on a side\" means on the line segment including endpoints.\n\nSo if E is at a vertex of the octagon, then |O1E| = R, and it is on a side (as an endpoint).\n\nAnd the square has center at E (a vertex of the octagon), and one vertex at O1, and radius R, so the distance from E to O1 is R, which is consistent.\n\nAnd the square is inscribed in a circle of radius R centered at E, with O1 on that circle.\n\nSo then O1E = R.\n\nSo the problem reduces to finding the circumradius R of a regular octagon with side length 3.\n\nThen the answer is R.\n\nLet me calculate that.\n\n## Step 2: Find the circumradius R of a regular octagon with side length s = 3.\n\nFor a regular octagon, the circumradius R is related to the side length s by:\n\nR = s / (2 * sin(π/8))\n\nBecause in a regular polygon with n sides, R = s / (2 * sin(π/n))\n\nHere n = 8, so:\n\nR = 3 / (2 * sin(π/8))\n\nNow, sin(π/8) = sin(22.5°) = √((1 - cos(45°))/2) = √((1 - √2/2)/2) = √( (2 - √2)/4 ) = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo R = 3 / (2 * √(2 - √2)/2) = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nRationalize the denominator:\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √(2 + √2):\n\nR = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √( (2 - √2)(2 + √2) ) = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √(4 - 2) = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nSimplify:\n\nR = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2 = 3 * √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = 3 * √(1 + √2/2)\n\nBut perhaps leave it as:\n\nR = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nWe can write it as:\n\nR = (3 / √2) * √(2 + √2)\n\nOr rationalize differently.\n\nNote that:\n\nR = 3 / (2 * sin(22.5°))\n\nBut perhaps compute numerically to check.\n\nsin(22.5°) ≈ 0.382683432365\n\nSo R ≈ 3 / (2 * 0.382683432365) ≈ 3 / 0.76536686473 ≈ 3.918\n\nBut let's keep exact.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\nR = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nRationalize:\n\nR = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √( (2 - √2)(2 + √2) ) = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √(4 - 2) = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nNow, √(2 + √2) / √2 = √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = √(1 + √2/2)\n\nBut perhaps we can simplify:\n\nR = (3/2) * √(2 + √2) * √2 / 1? No.\n\nR = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2 = 3 * √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = 3 * √(1 + √2/2)\n\nStill messy.\n\nI recall that for a regular octagon, R = s * (1 + √2) / 2? No, that's for the apothem or something else.\n\nLet me derive it properly.\n\nIn a regular octagon, the circumradius R and side length s are related by:\n\ns = 2 * R * sin(π/8)\n\nSo R = s / (2 * sin(π/8)) as before.\n\nAnd sin(π/8) = sin(22.5°) = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo R = s / (2 * √(2 - √2)/2) = s / √(2 - √2)\n\nAs before.\n\nNow, to simplify s / √(2 - √2)\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by √(2 + √2):\n\nR = s * √(2 + √2) / √( (2 - √2)(2 + √2) ) = s * √(2 + √2) / √(4 - 2) = s * √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nFor s=3:\n\nR = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nWe can write this as:\n\nR = (3/√2) * √(2 + √2) = 3 * √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = 3 * √(1 + √2/2)\n\nBut perhaps the problem expects a simplified radical form.\n\nNote that:\n\nR = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2 = 3 * √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = 3 * √(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2})\n\nBut I think the form 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2 is acceptable, or we can rationalize further.\n\nLet me square it to see if it simplifies.\n\nR^2 = [3 * √(2 + √2) / √2]^2 = 9 * (2 + √2) / 2 = (9/2) * (2 + √2) = 9 + (9√2)/2\n\nNot nice.\n\nPerhaps leave as R = 3 / (2 sin(22.5°)) but that's not numerical.\n\nAnother way: in a regular octagon, the circumradius R = s / (2 sin(22.5°)) and sin(22.5°) = √(2 - √2)/2, so R = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nAnd this is the exact value.\n\nBut perhaps for the answer, we can rationalize or simplify.\n\nI recall that for a regular octagon, the circumradius R = s * √(2 + √2) / 2? Let's check.\n\nIf R = s * √(2 + √2) / 2, then for s=3, R = 3 * √(2 + √2) / 2\n\nBut earlier we have R = 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nAre they equal? 3 * √(2 + √2) / 2 vs 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nOnly if 2 = √2, which is not true.\n\nSo no.\n\nLet's calculate numerical value to verify.\n\ns = 3\n\nsin(22.5°) = sin(π/8) = √(2 - √2)/2 ≈ √(2 - 1.4142)/2 = √(0.5858)/2 ≈ 0.7654/2 = 0.3827\n\nThen R = 3 / (2 * 0.3827) = 3 / 0.7654 ≈ 3.918\n\nNow, 3 * √(2 + √2) / √2 = 3 * √(2 + 1.4142) / 1.4142 = 3 * √(3.4142) / 1.4142 ≈ 3 * 1.8478 / 1.4142 ≈ 5.5434 / 1.4142 ≈ 3.918, same.\n\nNow, is there a better form? Perhaps the problem expects the answer as 3 / √(2 - √2) or rationalized.\n\nBut let's think again about the geometry.\n\nEarlier I assumed that |O1E| = R, because O1 is a vertex of the square, and the square's radius is R, so distance from center E to vertex O1 is R.\n\nBut is that correct? Yes, by definition, if the square is inscribed in a circle of radius R centered at E, then all vertices are at distance R from E, so |O1E| = R.\n\nAnd if E is on a side of the octagon, and |O1E| = R, then E must be at a vertex of the octagon, since only at vertices is the distance from center equal to R.\n\nAnd the problem says \"lies on a side\", which may include vertices.\n\nSo likely, E is at a vertex of the octagon, and O1E is the circumradius R.\n\nSo the answer is R = 3 / (2 sin(π/8)) = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nTo write it nicely, let's rationalize:\n\nR = 3 / √(2 - √2) * √(2 + √2)/√(2 + √2) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √(4 - 2) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nNow, we can write this as (3/√2) * √(2 + √2) = 3 * √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = 3 * √(1 + √2/2)\n\nBut perhaps the standard form is 3 * √(2 + √2) / 2? No, as we saw, that's different.\n\nI recall that in some sources, the circumradius of a regular octagon with side s is s * (1 + √2) / 2? Let's check.\n\nIf s=3, R = 3 * (1 + 1.4142)/2 = 3 * 2.4142/2 = 3 * 1.2071 = 3.6213, but earlier we had 3.918, so not that.\n\nThat might be the apothem or something else.\n\nThe apothem a = (s/2) * (1 + √2) for octagon? Let's see.\n\nApothem = R * cos(π/8) = R * cos(22.5°) = R * √(2 + √2)/2\n\nAnd R = s / (2 sin(π/8)) = s / (2 * √(2 - √2)/2) = s / √(2 - √2)\n\nSo a = [s / √(2 - √2)] * [√(2 + √2)/2] = s * √(2 + √2) / [2 √(2 - √2)] = s * √( (2 + √2)/(2 - √2) ) / 2\n\nRationalize (2 + √2)/(2 - √2) = [(2 + √2)^2] / (4 - 2) = (4 + 4√2 + 2)/2 = (6 + 4√2)/2 = 3 + 2√2\n\nSo a = s * √(3 + 2√2) / 2\n\nAnd 3 + 2√2 = (1 + √2)^2, so √(3 + 2√2) = 1 + √2\n\nSo a = s * (1 + √2) / 2\n\nYes! So apothem = s (1 + √2)/2\n\nFor s=3, a = 3(1 + √2)/2 ≈ 3*2.4142/2 = 3.6213, as before.\n\nBut we need circumradius R, not apothem.\n\nR = s / (2 sin(π/8)) = 3 / (2 * sin(22.5°)) \n\nAnd sin(22.5°) = √(2 - √2)/2, so R = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nAs before.\n\nPerhaps the answer is to be left as 3 / √(2 - √2), or rationalized.\n\nBut let's see the diagram. In the diagram, there are points A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,O1.\n\nFrom the diagram, it looks like the octagon is ABCDEFGH, and O1 is center, and there is a square, perhaps D,E,F,K or something.\n\nIn the diagram, we have points: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,O1.\n\nFrom the connections, it seems that the octagon is A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-A, and O1 is center.\n\nThen there is a square, perhaps D-E-F-K or something, but K is connected to J and F, J to I, I to D, so perhaps square is D-I-J-K or something.\n\nBut in the diagram, O1 is connected to D and E and F, and E is on the side, perhaps on side D-E or something.\n\nIn the diagram, E is on the side between D and F? Let's see the labels.\n\nFrom the diagram: points are labeled A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,O1.\n\nConnections: A-B, B-C, C-D, D-E, E-F, F-G, G-H, H-A for the octagon? But then D-E is a side, and E is on it, but E is also a vertex of the square.\n\nPerhaps the square is D-E-F-K or something.\n\nBut in the diagram, there is a square I-J-K-F or something.\n\nLooking at the diagram: from I to J, J to K, K to F, F to D, D to I? But D to I is there, and I to J, J to K, K to F, F to D, so perhaps square is D-I-J-K-F? That's five points.\n\nPerhaps the square is D-I-J-K, and F is another point.\n\nBut O1 is connected to D, E, F, and also to C1? The point is labeled O1, and there is a point C1, but in the text it's O1, so probably C1 is a typo or something.\n\nIn the diagram, there is a point labeled \"O1\" and also \"C1\", but in the text, it's O1, so perhaps C1 is O1.\n\nIn the diagram, it's labeled \"O1\" and \"C1\", but likely \"C1\" is a mistake, and it's O1.\n\nIn the diagram, there is a point labeled \"O1\" near the center, and \"C1\" on the line from D to F, but perhaps it's the same point.\n\nTo avoid confusion, let's assume that the square has vertices at D, I, J, K, and O1 is at D or something.\n\nBut the problem says \"one of its vertices coincides with the center O1\", so O1 is a vertex of the square.\n\nIn the diagram, O1 is at the center, and it is connected to D, E, F, so perhaps the square has vertices at O1, D, F, and another point.\n\nFrom the diagram, O1 is connected to D and to F, and D and F are connected, so perhaps triangle O1-D-F is part of the square.\n\nIf O1, D, F are three vertices of the square, then the fourth vertex would be such that it completes the square.\n\nIn a square, if O1 and D are adjacent, then F would be adjacent to D, so angle at D is 90 degrees.\n\nIn the octagon, at vertex D, the internal angle is 135 degrees, so if O1 is center, then angle O1-D-F might not be 90 degrees.\n\nPerhaps O1 and D are not adjacent in the square.\n\nPerhaps the square is O1, E, and two other points.\n\nThe problem says \"point E lies on a side of the octagon\", and \"segment O1E connects the center to the center of the square\".\n\nSo E is the center of the square, and O1 is a vertex of the square.\n\nSo in the square, E is center, O1 is a vertex, so the distance O1E is half the diagonal of the square.\n\nLet's denote the side of the square as a.\n\nThen the diagonal of the square is a√2, so from center to vertex is (a√2)/2 = a/√2.\n\nBut the problem says \"its radius equals the circumradius of the octagon\", so the distance from E to a vertex is R, the circumradius of the octagon.\n\nSo |O1E| = R.\n\nBut also, since E is the center of the square, and O1 is a vertex, |O1E| = distance from center to vertex = R.\n\nSo again, |O1E| = R.\n\nAnd E is on a side of the octagon.\n\nSo to resolve the contradiction, perhaps in this configuration, E is not on the side in the Euclidean distance sense, but in the diagram, it is on the side, and |O1E| is to be calculated, and it is not R, but the square's radius is R, so |O1E| = R, so it must be that the distance from O1 to E is R, and E is on a side, so for that to happen, E must be at a vertex of the octagon.\n\nSo I think we have to go with that.\n\nPerhaps \"radius\" of the square means something else, but typically for a square, \"radius\" means distance from center to vertex.\n\nSo I think the answer is the circumradius of the octagon with side 3.\n\nSo R = 3 / (2 * sin(π/8)) = 3 / (2 * sin(22.5°)) \n\nAnd sin(22.5°) = √(2 - √2)/2, so R = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nTo box the answer, perhaps simplify.\n\nLet me write R = 3 / √(2 - √2) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √2 as before.\n\nOr R = (3/2) * √(4 + 2√2) / 1, but let's see.\n\nNote that (√2 + 1) / 2 * something.\n\nI think the most simplified form is 3 * √(2 + √2) / 2? No, as calculated, it's not.\n\nLet's calculate the numerical value and see if it matches a nice expression.\n\nR ≈ 3.918\n\n3 * (1 + √2) / 2 = 3*2.4142/2 = 3.6213, not match.\n\n3 * √2 = 4.242, too big.\n\n3 * √(2) / 1 = 4.242\n\n3 * √(1.5) = 3*1.224 = 3.672, not.\n\nPerhaps 3 * √(2) * cos(22.5°) or something.\n\nAnother way: in regular octagon, the circumradius R = s / (2 sin(22.5°)) and sin(22.5°) = sin(45°/2) = √((1 - cos45°)/2) = √((1 - √2/2)/2) = √(2 - √2)/2, as before.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 3 / √(2 - √2) , and we can leave it like that, or rationalize.\n\nLet's rationalize the denominator:\n\n R = 3 / √(2 - √2) * √(2 + √2)/√(2 + √2) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √(4 - 2) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nNow, to make it nicer, write as (3/√2) * √(2 + √2) = 3 * √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = 3 * √(1 + √2/2)\n\nBut I think for the answer, we can box 3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} / \\sqrt{2} or simplify by writing as (3 \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} ) / 2, but let's see.\n\nNote that (√(2 + √2) / √2) = √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = √(1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}) \n\nOr perhaps leave as \\frac{3}{\\2 \\sin(\\pi/8)} but not numerical.\n\nPerhaps the problem has a different interpretation.\n\nLet's think differently.\n\nPerhaps \" its radius equals the circumradius of the octagon\" means that the square's circumradius is R, which is correct, and O1 is a vertex, so |O1E| = R.\n\nBut then E is on a side of the octagon, so in the octagon, the distance from O1 to a point E on a side is R, which only happens if E is at a vertex.\n\nSo perhaps in the diagram, E is at a vertex, and \"lies on a side\" is acceptable.\n\nSo I think we have to go with R = 3 / (2 sin(π/8)) = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nTo write it nicely, let's rationalize and simplify.\n\n R = 3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} / \\sqrt{2} = 3 \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} } = 3 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} \n\nBut perhaps the expected answer is \\frac{3}{\\2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} or something.\n\nNote that (2 + √2)/2 = 1 + √2/2, and 1 + √2/2 = (2 + √2)/2, same.\n\nI recall that in some geometry problems, the circumradius of a regular octagon is given as s * \\frac{\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{2} or something.\n\nLet's calculate R^2 = [3 / √(2 - √2)]^2 = 9 / (2 - √2) = 9 (2 + √2) / ((2 - √2)(2 + √2)) = 9 (2 + √2) / (4 - 2) = 9 (2 + √2) / 2 = (18 + 9√2)/2 = 9 + (9√2)/2\n\nNot nice.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 3 \\sqrt{2} / \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} but same thing.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"radius\" of the square means the distance from center to side, i.e., the apothem of the square, not to vertex.\n\nLet's check that.\n\nIf \"radius\" means the apothem, then for a square, apothem = a/2, where a is side length.\n\nThen the distance from center E to a side is a/2.\n\nBut the problem says \"its radius equals the circumradius of the octagon\", so a/2 = R.\n\nThen the distance from center E to a vertex is (a/2) * √2 = R * √2.\n\nBut O1 is a vertex of the square, so |O1E| = R * √2.\n\nAnd E is on a side of the octagon, so |O1E| is the distance from center to a point on a side, which is between apothem and R.\n\nFor octagon, apothem a = s (1 + √2)/2 = 3(1+1.4142)/2 = 3*2.4142/2 = 3.6213\n\nR = 3.918\n\nSo |O1E| = R * √2 ≈ 3.918 * 1.4142 ≈ 5.54, which is larger than R, but the maximum distance from center to a point on the octagon is R (at vertices), so 5.54 > R, impossible.\n\nSo \"radius\" must mean distance to vertex.\n\nTherefore, |O1E| = R.\n\nSo we must conclude that E is at a vertex of the octagon, and |O1E| = R = 3 / (2 sin(π/8)) = 3 / √(2 - √2)\n\nPerhaps the answer is to be left as \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} or rationalized.\n\nLet's rationalize it as 3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} / \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{2} ? Let's see.\n\n3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} / \\sqrt{2} = 3 \\sqrt{ (2 + \\sqrt{2}) / 2 } = 3 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}} \n\nOr 3 \\sqrt{ \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2} } = \\frac{3}{ \\sqrt{2} } \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} \n\nI think for the box, we can put \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2}} or simplify by multiplying numerator and denominator by \\sqrt{2}:\n\n \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \n\nAnd 4 + 2√2 = 2(2 + √2), so \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} , same as before.\n\nPerhaps \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} \n\nLet me calculate numerical value of \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} = 1.5 * \\sqrt{4 + 2*1.4142} = 1.5 * \\sqrt{4 + 2.8284} = 1.5 * \\sqrt{6.8284} = 1.5 * 2.613 = 3.9195, which matches R≈3.918, good.\n\nAnd \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} is a standard form.\n\nSo R = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} \n\nWe can factor: 4 + 2√2 = 2(2 + √2), so \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} , so R = \\frac{3}{2} * \\sqrt{2} * \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{2} , same as before.\n\nBut \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} is compact.\n\nSome people write it as \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} , but I think \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} is fine.\n\nSince 4 + 2√2 = (√2 + 1)^2 + 1^2 or something, but (√2 + 1)^2 = 2 + 2√2 + 1 = 3 + 2√2, not 4 + 2√2.\n\n4 + 2√2 = 2 + 2 + 2√2 = 2(1 + 1 + √2) , not helpful.\n\nSo I think \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} is a good form.\n\nWe can factor out the 2: \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2(2 + \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} , but perhaps not necessary.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\nTherefore, the length of segment O1E is \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} \n\nTo confirm, for s=1, R = 1/(2 sin(22.5°)) ≈ 1/0.7654 = 1.3066, and \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} = 0.5 * \\sqrt{4 + 2*1.4142} = 0.5 * \\sqrt{6.8284} = 0.5*2.613 = 1.3065, good.\n\nSo for s=3, R = 3 * 1.3066 = 3.9198, and \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} = 1.5 * 2.613 = 3.9195, good.\n\nSo the answer is \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} \n\nWe can write it as \\frac{3\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{2} \n\nNow, to box it.\n\nBut let's see if it can be simplified further. 4 + 2√2 = 2(2 + √2), so \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} , so R = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{2} \n\nSome may prefer this, but I think the first form is fine.\n\nSo I'll box \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} \n\nIn the problem, it's \"calculate the length\", so perhaps they want a simplified radical form.\n\nAnother way: since 4 + 2√2 = (√2 + 1)^2 + 1^2, but not a perfect square.\n\nSo I think this is as simplified as it gets.\n\nSo the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{2} \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}} \n\nTo make it look better, \\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{2}} \n\nYes. \n\nSo \\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{2}} \n\nI think that's the answer. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\frac{3\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{2}}\\]"
