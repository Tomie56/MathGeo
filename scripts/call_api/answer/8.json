    "We are given two circles of equal radius 5, and their centers O₁ and O₂ lie on each other’s circumference. That means the distance between O₁ and O₂ is equal to the radius, which is 5.\n\nLet’s denote:\n- Circle 1: Center O₁, radius 5\n- Circle 2: Center O₂, radius 5\n- Distance O₁O₂ = 5 (since each center lies on the other’s circumference)\n- Points A and B are the two intersection points of the circles.\n- We are to find the length of the **minor arc AB** on the **upper circle** (centered at O₂).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry\n\nWe have two circles intersecting, each with radius 5, and centers separated by 5. So triangle O₁AO₂ is formed by two radii (O₁A and O₂A) and the segment O₁O₂.\n\nSince O₁A = O₂A = O₁O₂ = 5, triangle O₁AO₂ is **equilateral**.\n\nSimilarly, triangle O₁BO₂ is also equilateral.\n\nTherefore, angle ∠AO₂B (the central angle subtended by arc AB in circle centered at O₂) is equal to the angle between vectors O₂A and O₂B.\n\nBut note: Points A and B are the two intersection points. In the equilateral triangle O₁AO₂, angle at O₂ is 60°. Similarly, in triangle O₁BO₂, angle at O₂ is 60°. But these are on opposite sides of O₁O₂.\n\nActually, to find angle ∠AO₂B, we can consider quadrilateral O₁AO₂B or just the triangle O₁AO₂ and O₁BO₂.\n\nBut better: since O₁ and O₂ are 5 apart, and both A and B lie on both circles, then points A and B are symmetric with respect to the line O₁O₂.\n\nIn triangle O₁AO₂, all sides are 5 → equilateral → angle at O₂ is 60°.\n\nSimilarly, in triangle O₁BO₂, angle at O₂ is 60°.\n\nBut these two angles are on opposite sides of O₁O₂, so the total angle ∠AO₂B = 60° + 60° = **120°**.\n\nWait — let’s verify this carefully.\n\nActually, in the plane, points A and B are the two intersection points of the circles. The line O₁O₂ is the perpendicular bisector of segment AB.\n\nIn triangle O₁AO₂, since all sides are 5, angle at O₂ is 60°. Similarly, angle at O₂ in triangle O₁BO₂ is also 60°, but on the other side of O₁O₂. So the angle between O₂A and O₂B — that is, angle AO₂B — is 60° + 60° = **120°**.\n\nYes, that’s correct.\n\nSo the central angle for arc AB in circle centered at O₂ is **120 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Calculate Arc Length\n\nThe formula for arc length is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Arc length} = r \\cdot \\theta\n\\]\n\nwhere θ is in **radians**.\n\nWe have radius r = 5, and central angle θ = 120°.\n\nConvert 120° to radians:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = 120^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180^\\circ} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nNow compute arc length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Arc length} = 5 \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{10\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm it’s the Minor Arc\n\nThe problem asks for the **minor arc** from A to B on the upper circle.\n\nSince the central angle is 120°, which is less than 180°, this is indeed the **minor arc**.\n\n(If it were 240°, that would be the major arc — but we have 120°, so minor.)\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{10\\pi}{3}}\n\\]"
