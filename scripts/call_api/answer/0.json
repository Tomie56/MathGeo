    "In the given figure, two congruent equilateral triangles are positioned such that one is translated perpendicularly from the other relative to one of its sides. The first triangle, centered at O1, has side length 1 and vertices A, B, and C. The second triangle, centered at O2, is a translation of the first and has vertices C, D, and E, with point F completing the structure as shown. Line segment DC is a side of the second triangle.\n\nDetermine the length of line segment DC."

  "answer": [
    "We are told that:\n\n- There are **two congruent equilateral triangles**.\n- The first triangle has vertices A, B, C and center O1.\n- The second triangle has vertices C, D, E and center O2.\n- The second triangle is a **translation** of the first **perpendicularly** from the first relative to one of its sides.\n- The side length of the first triangle is **1**.\n- We are to find the length of **DC**, which is stated to be a **side of the second triangle**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the implications of “congruent equilateral triangles”\n\nSince both triangles are **equilateral** and **congruent**, all their sides are equal in length. The first triangle has side length 1, so **all sides of the second triangle are also length 1**.\n\nTherefore, **DC is a side of the second equilateral triangle**, so:\n\n> **DC = 1**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm with the description\n\nThe problem says: “Line segment DC is a side of the second triangle.” Since the second triangle is equilateral and congruent to the first (which has side length 1), then **every side of the second triangle, including DC, must be length 1**.\n\nThe mention of translation and centers O1 and O2 is likely to provide context or to distract — but since the problem explicitly states that the triangles are congruent and equilateral, and DC is a side of the second triangle, the length is determined solely by the side length of the triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Address possible confusion\n\nOne might wonder: Is DC really a side? The problem says: “The second triangle, centered at O2, has vertices C, D, and E, with point F completing the structure as shown.” And then: “Line segment DC is a side of the second triangle.”\n\nSo yes — the second triangle is CDE, and DC is one of its sides.\n\nTherefore, **DC = side length of equilateral triangle = 1**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$\\boxed{1}$"
