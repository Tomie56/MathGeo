    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle. Points D, E, and F are additional points of tangency or intersection along the sides of triangle ABC and the smaller circle.

    "We are given a geometric construction:\n\n- A small circle centered at O1 with radius 5.\n- It is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10.\n- Triangle ABC is circumscribed about the smaller circle (i.e., the smaller circle is the incircle of triangle ABC).\n- Vertices A, B, C lie on the larger circle (radius 10).\n- Points D, E, F are points of tangency or intersection — likely the points where the incircle touches the sides of triangle ABC.\n\nWe are to compute the **radian measure of angle BAC**, using **vector methods**, and express it as an **exact multiple of π**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\nWe have:\n\n- Incircle of triangle ABC: center O1, radius r = 5.\n- Circumcircle of triangle ABC: center also O1 (since the larger circle is concentric), radius R = 10.\n\nWait — this is **crucial**.\n\nIn a general triangle, the incenter and circumcenter are **not** the same point — unless the triangle is **equilateral**.\n\nBut here, both circles are **concentric** — meaning the incenter and circumcenter coincide.\n\nThis **only happens** if the triangle is **equilateral**.\n\n✅ **Conclusion**: Triangle ABC is **equilateral**.\n\nWhy?\n\n- In any triangle, if the incenter and circumcenter coincide, the triangle is equilateral.\n- Proof sketch: The incenter is the intersection of angle bisectors; the circumcenter is the intersection of perpendicular bisectors. If they coincide, then the angle bisectors are also perpendicular bisectors, which only happens in equilateral triangles.\n\nTherefore, triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Compute angle BAC\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, **all angles are equal** and sum to π radians.\n\nSo,\n\n> ∠BAC = π/3 radians.\n\n✅ That’s the answer.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Verify using vector methods (as required)\n\nThe problem asks to use **vector methods**. So even though we deduced the triangle is equilateral, we must compute angle BAC using vectors.\n\nLet’s place the triangle in the coordinate plane with center O1 at the origin.\n\nSince ABC is equilateral and inscribed in a circle of radius 10 centered at origin, we can assign coordinates to A, B, C using complex numbers or vectors.\n\nLet’s place point A at (10, 0).\n\nSince the triangle is equilateral and inscribed in a circle of radius 10, the other vertices are at angles 120° and 240° (i.e., 2π/3 and 4π/3 radians) from the positive x-axis.\n\nSo:\n\n- Vector OA = <10, 0>\n- Vector OB = <10 cos(2π/3), 10 sin(2π/3)> = <10*(-1/2), 10*(√3/2)> = <-5, 5√3>\n- Vector OC = <10 cos(4π/3), 10 sin(4π/3)> = <10*(-1/2), 10*(-√3/2)> = <-5, -5√3>\n\nNow, we want angle at A — that is, angle between vectors AB and AC.\n\nSo, we need vectors:\n\n- Vector AB = OB - OA = <-5 - 10, 5√3 - 0> = <-15, 5√3>\n- Vector AC = OC - OA = <-5 - 10, -5√3 - 0> = <-15, -5√3>\n\nNow, use the dot product formula:\n\n> cosθ = (AB · AC) / (|AB| |AC|)\n\nCompute AB · AC:\n\n= (-15)(-15) + (5√3)(-5√3)\n= 225 - 25*3\n= 225 - 75\n= 150\n\nCompute |AB|:\n\n= √[(-15)^2 + (5√3)^2] = √[225 + 75] = √300 = 10√3\n\nSimilarly, |AC| = √[(-15)^2 + (-5√3)^2] = √[225 + 75] = √300 = 10√3\n\nSo,\n\ncosθ = 150 / (10√3 * 10√3) = 150 / (100 * 3) = 150 / 300 = 0.5\n\nTherefore,\n\nθ = arccos(0.5) = π/3 radians.\n\n✅ Confirmed via vector method.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nThe radian measure of angle BAC is **π/3**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
