    "We are given a geometric construction involving two congruent regular triangles (equilateral triangles), one centered at O1 and the other at O2, with a perpendicular translation between them. We are to find the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle at vertex A between segments AB and AC — expressed as a multiple of π.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup\n\n- We have a **regular triangle** (equilateral triangle) centered at O1 with side length 1. Let’s assume this is triangle ABC, since points A, B, C are labeled and connected.\n- Then, a second congruent triangle is generated by a **perpendicular translation**, centered at O2. This triangle is likely DEF, since D, E, F are also labeled and connected.\n- M₀ is the midpoint of AB.\n- M₁ is the midpoint of EC.\n- We are to find ∠BAC — the angle at A between AB and AC.\n\nWait — this is critical: **If triangle ABC is equilateral, then ∠BAC is 60 degrees, or π/3 radians.**\n\nBut let’s verify if triangle ABC is indeed equilateral.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze triangle ABC\n\nThe problem says:\n\n> “a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 1 is initially positioned.”\n\nThis implies that triangle ABC (or whatever triangle is centered at O1) is **equilateral** with side length 1.\n\nNow, the labeling: points A, B, C are connected — AB, BC, and AC are drawn (from the diagram description: 8 line segments, and we can infer AB, AC, BC are among them).\n\nSo if ABC is the initial regular triangle centered at O1, then by definition, all sides are equal and all angles are 60°.\n\nTherefore, ∠BAC = 60° = π/3 radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Check for possible trick or misinterpretation\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n- A second triangle centered at O2, generated by perpendicular translation.\n- Midpoints M₀ (of AB) and M₁ (of EC) are connected.\n- But we are asked for ∠BAC — which is entirely within the first triangle.\n\nThe second triangle and the midpoints are red herrings for this particular question — unless the construction somehow distorts triangle ABC.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\n> “a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 1 is initially positioned. After one round of derivation involving a perpendicular translation to generate a second congruent triangle centered at O2...”\n\nThis implies the first triangle remains unchanged — the second is a translated copy. So triangle ABC is still equilateral.\n\nMoreover, the angle ∠BAC is formed by segments AB and AC — both belonging to the original triangle.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the other points and constructions, **∠BAC is an internal angle of an equilateral triangle**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, each internal angle is:\n\n> 60° = π/3 radians.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}}$"
