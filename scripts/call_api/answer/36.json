    "In the given diagram, a regular hexagon with center O1 and side length 5 is inscribed, rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scaled by 1/2) is drawn inside it, sharing the same center O1. Points M₀ and M₁ are defined as the midpoints of two adjacent sides of the outer hexagon — specifically, M₀ lies on side AB and M₁ lies on side AF.

    "We are given a regular hexagon with center O1 and side length 5, rotated by π/6 radians. Inside it, there is a concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scaled by 1/2), but we are not directly using that for the current question. We are to find the length of the segment M₀M₁, where:\n\n- M₀ is the midpoint of side AB of the outer hexagon.\n- M₁ is the midpoint of side AF of the outer hexagon.\n- AB and AF are adjacent sides of the outer hexagon (sharing vertex A).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry of a Regular Hexagon\n\nA regular hexagon can be inscribed in a circle. Each internal angle is 120°, and each central angle (angle at center between two adjacent vertices) is 60° (since 360°/6 = 60°).\n\nThe side length of the hexagon equals the radius of the circumscribed circle. So, since side length = 5, the distance from center O1 to any vertex is 5.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Place the Hexagon on the Coordinate Plane\n\nWe are told the hexagon is rotated by π/6 radians (30°). Let’s place the center O1 at the origin (0,0).\n\nIn a standard (non-rotated) regular hexagon, the vertices lie at angles 0°, 60°, 120°, ..., 300°.\n\nBut since it’s rotated by π/6 (30°), we add 30° to each angle.\n\nSo the six vertices are at angles:\n\n- 30°, 90°, 150°, 210°, 270°, 330°\n\nLet’s label the vertices in order: A, B, C, D, E, F — going counterclockwise.\n\nWe can assign:\n\n- A at 30°\n- B at 90°\n- C at 150°\n- D at 210°\n- E at 270°\n- F at 330°\n\nThis makes sense: AB is from 30° to 90°, AF is from 30° to 330° — which are adjacent sides sharing vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute Coordinates of Points A, B, F\n\nWe’ll use polar to Cartesian conversion:\n\nx = r * cos(θ), y = r * sin(θ)\n\nWith r = 5.\n\n**Point A (30°):**\n\nθ = 30° = π/6 radians\n\nx_A = 5 * cos(π/6) = 5 * (√3/2) = (5√3)/2\n\ny_A = 5 * sin(π/6) = 5 * (1/2) = 5/2\n\n→ A = ( (5√3)/2 , 5/2 )\n\n**Point B (90°):**\n\nθ = π/2\n\nx_B = 5 * cos(π/2) = 0\n\ny_B = 5 * sin(π/2) = 5\n\n→ B = (0, 5)\n\n**Point F (330°):**\n\nθ = 330° = 11π/6 radians\n\nx_F = 5 * cos(11π/6) = 5 * (√3/2) = (5√3)/2\n\ny_F = 5 * sin(11π/6) = 5 * (-1/2) = -5/2\n\n→ F = ( (5√3)/2 , -5/2 )\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find Midpoints M₀ and M₁\n\n**M₀ is midpoint of AB:**\n\nA = ( (5√3)/2 , 5/2 ), B = (0, 5)\n\nM₀_x = [ (5√3)/2 + 0 ] / 2 = (5√3)/4\n\nM₀_y = [ 5/2 + 5 ] / 2 = [ 5/2 + 10/2 ] / 2 = (15/2)/2 = 15/4\n\n→ M₀ = ( (5√3)/4 , 15/4 )\n\n**M₁ is midpoint of AF:**\n\nA = ( (5√3)/2 , 5/2 ), F = ( (5√3)/2 , -5/2 )\n\nM₁_x = [ (5√3)/2 + (5√3)/2 ] / 2 = (5√3)/2\n\nM₁_y = [ 5/2 + (-5/2) ] / 2 = 0 / 2 = 0\n\n→ M₁ = ( (5√3)/2 , 0 )\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute Distance Between M₀ and M₁\n\nUse distance formula:\n\nM₀M₁ = √[ (x₂ - x₁)² + (y₂ - y₁)² ]\n\nLet M₀ = (x₁, y₁) = ( (5√3)/4 , 15/4 )\n\nM₁ = (x₂, y₂) = ( (5√3)/2 , 0 )\n\nCompute differences:\n\nΔx = x₂ - x₁ = (5√3)/2 - (5√3)/4 = (10√3)/4 - (5√3)/4 = (5√3)/4\n\nΔy = y₂ - y₁ = 0 - 15/4 = -15/4\n\nNow square them:\n\n(Δx)² = [ (5√3)/4 ]² = (25 * 3) / 16 = 75/16\n\n(Δy)² = [ -15/4 ]² = 225/16\n\nSum = 75/16 + 225/16 = 300/16 = 75/4\n\nTake square root:\n\nM₀M₁ = √(75/4) = (√75)/2 = (5√3)/2\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\n$$"
