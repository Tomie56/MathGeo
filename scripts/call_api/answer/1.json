    "We are given a geometric construction involving two congruent equilateral triangles: triangle ABC (centered at O1) and triangle CDF (centered at O2). Both have side length 1. Triangle CDF is obtained by translating triangle ABC **perpendicular to side AB** by a distance equal to the **height** of the triangle. Point E lies on CF such that CE = 1, and D is positioned such that CD = 1 and angle DCF = 60°, preserving the equilateral structure.\n\nWe are to find the **radian measure of angle BAC**, using **vector methods**, and express it as a **multiple of π**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the problem\n\nWe are asked to find angle BAC — that is, the angle at vertex A between segments AB and AC — in triangle ABC.\n\nBut triangle ABC is given to be **equilateral**. In an equilateral triangle, **all internal angles are 60°**, or **π/3 radians**.\n\nSo, **angle BAC = π/3 radians**.\n\nBut the problem says: “using vector methods” and “express the result as a multiple of π”.\n\nThis suggests that perhaps the problem is testing whether we can derive this result using vectors, even though it’s obvious from the equilateral triangle property.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there’s a trick — perhaps the triangle is not actually equilateral in the final configuration? Let’s re-read.\n\n> “two congruent equilateral triangles are positioned such that triangle ABC (centered at O1) and triangle CDF (centered at O2) share vertex C. Triangle CDF is obtained by translating triangle ABC perpendicular to side AB by a distance equal to its height.”\n\nThis implies that triangle ABC is equilateral, and triangle CDF is a **translated copy** of ABC — so also equilateral — and they share vertex C.\n\nAlso: “Point E lies on segment CF such that CE = 1, and point D is positioned such that CD = 1 and angle DCF = 60°, preserving the equilateral structure.”\n\nThis is consistent with triangle CDF being equilateral: CD = CF = DF = 1, angle DCF = 60°, etc.\n\nSo triangle ABC is equilateral → angle BAC = 60° = π/3 radians.\n\nBut the problem says “using vector methods”, so we must **derive** this using vectors.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Set up coordinate system\n\nLet’s place triangle ABC in the coordinate plane to compute angle BAC using vectors.\n\nSince we are to use vector methods, let’s assign coordinates to points A, B, and C.\n\nLet’s place point A at the origin: **A = (0, 0)**.\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 1, and we want to compute angle at A, we can place point B along the x-axis.\n\nSo let’s set:\n\n- **A = (0, 0)**\n- **B = (1, 0)**\n\nNow, point C must be such that AC = 1 and BC = 1.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the height is h = √3/2.\n\nSo point C is located at the top vertex: **C = (0.5, √3/2)**\n\nThis is standard placement for an equilateral triangle with base AB on x-axis from (0,0) to (1,0).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Define vectors for angle BAC\n\nAngle BAC is the angle at A between vectors **AB** and **AC**.\n\nVectors:\n\n- **Vector AB = B - A = (1, 0) - (0, 0) = (1, 0)**\n- **Vector AC = C - A = (0.5, √3/2) - (0, 0) = (0.5, √3/2)**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use dot product formula to find angle\n\nThe formula for the angle θ between two vectors **u** and **v** is:\n\n> **cosθ = (u · v) / (|u| |v|)**\n\nCompute dot product:\n\n**AB · AC = (1)(0.5) + (0)(√3/2) = 0.5**\n\nCompute magnitudes:\n\n- |AB| = √(1² + 0²) = 1\n- |AC| = √(0.5² + (√3/2)²) = √(0.25 + 0.75) = √1 = 1\n\nSo,\n\n> **cosθ = 0.5 / (1 * 1) = 0.5**\n\nThus,\n\n> **θ = arccos(0.5) = π/3 radians**\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nWe have derived using vector methods that angle BAC is **π/3 radians**.\n\nThis matches the known property of equilateral triangles.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}}$"
