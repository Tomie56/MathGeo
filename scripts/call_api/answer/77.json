  "answer": [
    "Actually, there is a **critical misstatement** in the problem description.\n\n> “a circle with center O1 and radius 5 is inscribed within an equilateral triangle ABC, which is itself circumscribed about the circle.”\n\nThis is **redundant and slightly misleading**. If a circle is **inscribed** in a triangle, then the triangle is **circumscribed about** the circle — that’s just two ways of saying the same thing. So that part is fine.\n\nBut then it says:\n\n> “Point M₀ is the midpoint of side BC. A line segment is drawn from vertex B to point M₀.”\n\nWait — if M₀ is the **midpoint of BC**, then the segment **BM₀** is **half of side BC**.\n\nSo the problem reduces to: **In an equilateral triangle ABC with an incircle of radius 5, find half the length of a side.**\n\nLet’s solve it step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Recall properties of an equilateral triangle and its incircle.\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle** with side length **s**:\n\n- The **inradius** (radius of the incircle) is given by:\n\n  \\[\n  r = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n  \\]\n\n  This formula comes from the fact that in an equilateral triangle:\n\n  - Height \\( h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s \\)\n  - The inradius is one-third of the height (since centroid, incenter, orthocenter, etc., all coincide), so:\n\n    \\[\n    r = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot h = \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n    \\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the given inradius to find side length s.\n\nWe are told that the inradius \\( r = 5 \\).\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by 6:\n\n\\[\n30 = s \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSolve for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\ns = \\frac{30}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{30 \\sqrt{3}}{3} = 10 \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find length of BM₀.\n\nSince M₀ is the **midpoint of BC**, and BC is a side of the equilateral triangle of length \\( s = 10\\sqrt{3} \\), then:\n\n\\[\nBM_0 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = 5\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]"
