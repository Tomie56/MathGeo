    "We are given two circles of equal radius 5. The center of the upper circle, O2, lies on the circumference of the lower circle centered at O1. The circles intersect at points A and B. We are to find the measure of arc AO1 along the lower circle — that is, the arc from point A to point O1 along the circumference of the lower circle (centered at O1).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- Circle 1: Center O1, radius 5.\n- Circle 2: Center O2, radius 5.\n- O2 lies on the circumference of Circle 1 → so distance O1O2 = 5.\n- The two circles intersect at points A and B.\n\nWe are to find the measure of arc AO1 along the lower circle (Circle 1). That is, the arc from A to O1 along Circle 1.\n\nNote: Arc AO1 is not from A to O1 as a straight line — it’s along the circumference of Circle 1. But O1 is the center of Circle 1 — so O1 is not on the circumference! Wait — this is a problem.\n\nHold on — **O1 is the center of the lower circle, so it cannot lie on its own circumference**. So arc AO1 along the lower circle doesn’t make sense if O1 is the center — unless we misinterpreted.\n\nWait — perhaps the problem meant arc **from A to B**, or perhaps **from A to some point on the circle**? But it specifically says “arc AO1”.\n\nLet me reread:\n\n> “Consider the arc from point A to point O1 along the lower circle (arc AO1).”\n\nThis is geometrically impossible if O1 is the center — because O1 is not on the circle.\n\nUnless... perhaps there’s a typo? Or perhaps O1 is meant to be a point on the circle? But the diagram shows O1 as the center.\n\nWait — looking at the diagram description (even though we can’t see it, the text says):\n\n> “O1” and “O2” are marked as centers, and points A and B are intersection points.\n\nSo O1 is center of lower circle, O2 is center of upper circle.\n\nSo arc AO1 along the lower circle — but O1 is not on the circle.\n\nThis must be a mistake in interpretation.\n\nWait — perhaps the problem means the arc from A to the point **on the lower circle** that is diametrically opposite or something? Or perhaps it means the arc from A to the point where the line O1O2 meets the circle?\n\nWait — another possibility: perhaps “arc AO1” is meant to be **arc AB**, but that’s not what it says.\n\nAlternatively — perhaps the problem is asking for the arc from A to the point where the line from O1 through O2 intersects the lower circle again? But that point is not labeled.\n\nWait — let me think differently.\n\nPerhaps the problem is asking for the arc from A to the point on the lower circle that lies along the line O1O2 — that is, the point diametrically opposite to O2? But O2 is on the circle, so the point opposite would be the other end of the diameter through O2.\n\nLet’s try to reconstruct the diagram.\n\nWe have:\n\n- Circle 1: center O1, radius 5.\n- Circle 2: center O2, radius 5.\n- O2 lies on Circle 1 → so O1O2 = 5.\n- The two circles intersect at A and B.\n\nSince both circles have radius 5, and O1O2 = 5, the triangle O1AO2 is equilateral!\n\nWhy? Because:\n\n- O1A = 5 (radius of Circle 1)\n- O2A = 5 (radius of Circle 2)\n- O1O2 = 5 (given)\n\nSo triangle O1AO2 is equilateral → all angles are 60 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, triangle O1BO2 is also equilateral.\n\nTherefore, angle AO1B is the angle at O1 between points A and B.\n\nBut we are asked for arc AO1 — again, O1 is the center.\n\nWait — perhaps the problem meant arc **AB**? Or arc **AO2**? But it says AO1.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps “arc AO1” is a typo, and it should be “arc AB” — but let’s see what arc AO1 could mean.\n\nPerhaps it means the arc from A to the point where the line O1O2 intersects the lower circle again — that is, the point diametrically opposite to O2.\n\nLet’s call that point C. So if O2 is on the circle, then the point C such that O1 is the midpoint of O2C, and C is on the circle.\n\nThen arc AC would be from A to C along the circle.\n\nBut the problem says arc AO1 — which is still not on the circle.\n\nUnless... perhaps in the diagram, O1 is labeled at a point on the circle? But that contradicts the description.\n\nWait — let me look back at the user’s diagram description:\n\n> “O1” and “O2” are marked as centers, and points A and B are intersection points.\n\nSo O1 is center.\n\nPerhaps the problem is misstated, and it should be “arc AB” or “arc AO2”.\n\nBut let’s assume that “arc AO1” is a mistake, and it should be “arc AB” — that would make sense.\n\nBecause in many such problems, we are asked for the measure of arc AB.\n\nAnd since triangle O1AO2 is equilateral, angle AO1O2 is 60 degrees.\n\nSimilarly, angle BO1O2 is 60 degrees.\n\nSo angle AO1B = angle AO1O2 + angle BO1O2 = 60 + 60 = 120 degrees.\n\nTherefore, arc AB on the lower circle would be 120 degrees.\n\nBut the problem asks for arc AO1.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps “arc AO1” means the arc from A to the point on the circle that is O1’s “position” — but that doesn’t make sense.\n\nWait — perhaps in the diagram, there is a point labeled O1 on the circle? But the text says O1 is the center.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the problem.\n\nPerhaps it should be “arc AO2” — that is, from A to O2 along the lower circle.\n\nSince O2 is on the lower circle (given), and A is on the lower circle, then arc AO2 is a valid arc on the lower circle.\n\nAnd we can find its measure.\n\nLet’s assume that’s what was intended — because otherwise, the problem is impossible.\n\nSo let’s proceed with that assumption: the problem meant to ask for the measure of arc AO2 along the lower circle.\n\nThat is, the arc from A to O2 on the lower circle (centered at O1).\n\nSince both A and O2 are on the lower circle, and O1 is the center, we can find the central angle AO1O2.\n\nAs established, triangle O1AO2 is equilateral — all sides 5.\n\nTherefore, angle AO1O2 = 60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, the arc AO2 on the lower circle has measure 60 degrees.\n\nSo if the problem meant arc AO2, the answer is 60 degrees.\n\nBut the problem says arc AO1.\n\nPerhaps it’s arc from A to the point where the line O1O2 intersects the circle on the other side — let’s call that point C.\n\nSo if O2 is on the circle, then C is the point such that O1 is between O2 and C, and O1C = 5, so O2C = 10, diameter.\n\nThen arc AC would be from A to C.\n\nAngle AO1C would be angle AO1O2 + angle O2O1C.\n\nBut angle O2O1C is 180 degrees, since C is opposite O2.\n\nAngle AO1O2 is 60 degrees, so angle AO1C = 60 + 180 = 240 degrees? But that's the reflex angle.\n\nThe minor arc AC would be the smaller one.\n\nFrom A to C, passing through B or not.\n\nLet’s calculate the angle.\n\nIn triangle O1AO2, angle at O1 is 60 degrees.\n\nThe point C is on the line O1O2 extended, so the angle from A to C via the short way.\n\nThe total circle is 360 degrees.\n\nThe arc from A to O2 is 60 degrees (minor arc).\n\nThen from O2 to C is 180 degrees (since O2 to C is diameter).\n\nSo arc A to C via O2 is 60 + 180 = 240 degrees.\n\nThe minor arc A to C would be the other way: 360 - 240 = 120 degrees.\n\nBut that's arc A to C via B.\n\nAnd we know that angle AO1B is 120 degrees, as earlier.\n\nSo arc AB is 120 degrees.\n\nBut again, not AO1.\n\nPerhaps the problem is asking for the arc from A to the point O1, but since O1 is the center, it's not on the circle, so the arc doesn't exist.\n\nI think the only logical conclusion is that there is a typo, and it should be arc AO2 or arc AB.\n\nGiven that in many such problems, the arc between intersection points is asked, and it's 120 degrees, or the arc to the other center is 60 degrees.\n\nBut let's look at the diagram description again: \"arc AO1\" — and in the diagram, O1 is the center.\n\nPerhaps \"O1\" in \"arc AO1\" is a mislabel, and it should be \"B\" or \"O2\".\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps \"O1\" is meant to be the point on the circle directly below or something.\n\nBut I think the most reasonable assumption is that the problem meant arc AO2.\n\nAnd since the central angle is 60 degrees, the arc measure is 60 degrees.\n\nPerhaps the problem is asking for the arc from A to O1 along the circle, but since O1 is not on the circle, it's undefined.\n\nUnless — wait — in some contexts, \"arc AO1\" might mean the arc from A to the point where the radius O1A meets the circle, but that's just A itself.\n\nI'm stuck.\n\nLet me try to search for similar problems.\n\nIn standard geometry, when two circles of radius r intersect with centers separated by r, the angle at each center for the arc between intersection points is 120 degrees.\n\nFor example, in this case, angle AO1B = 120 degrees, as we calculated.\n\nAnd the arc AB is 120 degrees.\n\nPerhaps the problem meant arc AB, and \"O1\" is a typo for \"B\".\n\nBecause \"B\" and \"O1\" might look similar in some fonts.\n\nOr perhaps in the diagram, the point B is labeled as O1, but the text says O1 is the center.\n\nI think the best course is to assume that \"arc AO1\" is a typo, and it should be \"arc AB\", which is 120 degrees.\n\nOr \"arc AO2\", which is 60 degrees.\n\nLet's see what makes sense with the diagram.\n\nIn the diagram, points A and B are intersection points, O1 and O2 are centers.\n\nThe arc from A to O1 — perhaps they mean the arc from A to the point on the circle that is in the direction of O1, but O1 is the center, so every point is in some direction.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"arc AO1\" means the arc from A to the point where the line O1A intersects the circle again — but that's the same point A, since O1A is a radius, and it intersects the circle at A and at the opposite point.\n\nAh! That's it!\n\nThe line O1A is a radius, and it intersects the circle at A and at the point diametrically opposite to A, let's call it A'.\n\nSo perhaps \"arc AO1\" is a misnomer, and it should be arc AA' or something.\n\nBut the problem says \"arc AO1\", and O1 is the center.\n\nPerhaps in some contexts, \"O1\" is used to denote the point diametrically opposite, but that's not standard.\n\nI recall that in some old texts, the center is denoted, but for arcs, they might mean from A to the center's \"projection\" or something.\n\nI think I need to make a decision.\n\nLet me calculate the arc from A to O2, as it's a common question.\n\nCentral angle AO1O2 = 60 degrees, so arc AO2 = 60 degrees.\n\nOr arc AB = 120 degrees.\n\nNow, the problem says \"arc AO1\", and in the diagram, O1 is the center, so perhaps they mean the arc from A to the point on the circle that is closest to O1 or something.\n\nPerhaps \"O1\" is a typo for \"B\".\n\nLet's assume that, and box 120 degrees.\n\nBut let's see the answer.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps \"arc AO1\" means the arc from A to the point O1 on the circle, but since O1 is not on the circle, it's impossible.\n\nUnless the radius is not 5, but the distance is 5, but no.\n\nI think the only logical answer is that the arc is 60 degrees, assuming they meant arc AO2.\n\nPerhaps the problem is to find the arc from A to the point where the line O1O2 meets the circle, which is O2, so arc AO2 = 60 degrees.\n\nI'll go with that.\n\nSo the measure of arc AO2 is 60 degrees.\n\nTherefore, if the problem meant that, the answer is 60 degrees.\n\nPerhaps \"O1\" is a mislabel for \"O2\".\n\nIn the diagram, O1 is lower center, O2 is upper center.\n\nArc from A to O2 on the lower circle.\n\nYes.\n\nSo I think the answer is 60 degrees.\n\nLet's box that.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's calculate it.\n\nIn triangle O1AO2:\n\n- O1A = 5\n- O2A = 5\n- O1O2 = 5\n\nSo it is equilateral.\n\nTherefore, angle at O1, angle AO1O2 = 60 degrees.\n\nThis is the central angle for arc AO2 on the lower circle.\n\nTherefore, the measure of arc AO2 is 60 degrees.\n\nSo if the problem meant arc AO2, answer is 60 degrees.\n\nI think that's the intended question.\n\nSo I'll go with that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{60}"
