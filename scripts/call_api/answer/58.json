    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10.

    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric circles and a triangle circumscribed about the smaller circle, with its vertices on the larger circle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup\n\n- **Smaller circle**: Center O1, radius = 5.\n- **Larger circle**: Same center O1, radius = 10 (obtained by scaling the smaller circle by factor 2).\n- **Triangle ABC**: Circumscribed about the smaller circle → the smaller circle is the **incircle** of triangle ABC.\n- Vertices A, B, C lie on the larger circle → triangle ABC is **inscribed** in the larger circle (radius 10).\n- So, triangle ABC has:\n  - **Incircle** of radius 5 (centered at O1),\n  - **Circumcircle** of radius 10 (also centered at O1).\n\nThis is a **very special triangle**: it is both **inscribed in a circle of radius R = 10** and **has an incircle of radius r = 5**, and **both circles are concentric**.\n\nThis is only possible for an **equilateral triangle**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Prove that triangle ABC must be equilateral\n\nIn general, for any triangle, the distance $ d $ between the incenter and circumcenter is given by:\n\n$$\nd^2 = R(R - 2r)\n$$\n\nWhere:\n- $ R $ = circumradius,\n- $ r $ = inradius.\n\nIn our case, since both circles are concentric, $ d = 0 $, so:\n\n$$\n0 = R(R - 2r) \\Rightarrow R = 2r\n$$\n\nGiven $ r = 5 $, then $ R = 10 $, which matches our setup.\n\nThe condition $ R = 2r $ **holds if and only if the triangle is equilateral**.\n\n✅ So, triangle ABC is **equilateral**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use properties of equilateral triangle\n\nLet’s denote the side length of equilateral triangle ABC as $ s $.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle:\n\n- **Circumradius**: $ R = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} $\n- **Inradius**: $ r = \\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}} $\n\nCheck:\n\n$$\n\\frac{R}{r} = \\frac{\\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}}{\\frac{s}{2\\sqrt{3}}} = 2\n\\Rightarrow R = 2r\n$$\n\nWhich matches our case (R = 10, r = 5).\n\nSo, using $ R = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = 10 $, solve for $ s $:\n\n$$\ns = 10 \\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find the length of the perpendicular from B to line AC\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the perpendicular from any vertex to the opposite side is the **altitude**.\n\nThe formula for the altitude $ h $ of an equilateral triangle with side $ s $ is:\n\n$$\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s\n$$\n\nSubstitute $ s = 10\\sqrt{3} $:\n\n$$\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 10\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{10 \\cdot 3}{2} = \\frac{30}{2} = 15\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe perpendicular from point B to line AC (which is side AC of triangle ABC) is the **altitude** of the equilateral triangle, and its length is **15**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{15}\n$$"
