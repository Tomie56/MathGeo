    "Let’s solve this step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nWe are given:\n\n- A large circle centered at O1 with radius 10 → this is the **circumcircle** of equilateral triangle ABC.\n- A smaller concentric circle (same center O1) with radius 5 → this is the **incircle** of triangle ABC.\n- Points D, E, F are points of tangency of the incircle with sides AB, BC, and AC respectively.\n- Segment DE connects tangency points on AB and BC.\n- We extend DE to intersect the large circle again at point B (which is already a vertex of the triangle).\n\nWe are to find the length of segment **DB**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use properties of equilateral triangle\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle**, the circumcenter, incenter, centroid, and orthocenter all coincide at the same point — here, O1.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- R = circumradius = 10\n- r = inradius = 5\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the relationship between the circumradius R and inradius r is:\n\n> **r = R / 2**\n\nIndeed, here r = 5, R = 10 → satisfies r = R/2 → consistent with equilateral triangle.\n\nAlso, for an equilateral triangle with side length s:\n\n> R = s / √3  \n> r = s / (2√3)\n\nWait — let’s double-check that.\n\nActually, standard formulas:\n\nFor equilateral triangle of side length **s**:\n\n- Height h = (√3 / 2) * s\n- Centroid (which is also incenter and circumcenter) divides the height in ratio 2:1.\n\nSo:\n\n- Circumradius R = (2/3) * h = (2/3) * (√3 / 2) * s = (√3 / 3) * s = s / √3\n- Inradius r = (1/3) * h = (1/3) * (√3 / 2) * s = (√3 / 6) * s = s / (2√3)\n\nThus, R = 2r → which matches our case: R = 10, r = 5.\n\nSo, side length s = R * √3 = 10√3.\n\nAlternatively, s = 2√3 * r = 2√3 * 5 = 10√3 — same.\n\nSo, side length of triangle ABC is **10√3**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Coordinates — place the triangle for calculation\n\nTo compute distances, let’s place the triangle in coordinate plane with center O1 at origin (0,0).\n\nIn an equilateral triangle with circumcenter at origin, we can place the vertices as follows:\n\nLet’s place point A at (R, 0) = (10, 0)\n\nThen, since it’s equilateral, the other points are at 120° and 240°:\n\n- B: (10 cos 120°, 10 sin 120°) = (10*(-1/2), 10*(√3/2)) = (-5, 5√3)\n- C: (10 cos 240°, 10 sin 240°) = (10*(-1/2), 10*(-√3/2)) = (-5, -5√3)\n\nWait — let’s verify the side length between A(10,0) and B(-5, 5√3):\n\nDistance AB = √[ (10 - (-5))² + (0 - 5√3)² ] = √[15² + (5√3)²] = √[225 + 75] = √300 = 10√3 — correct.\n\nSimilarly, BC: from B(-5,5√3) to C(-5,-5√3): distance = √[0 + (10√3)²] = 10√3 — correct.\n\nAC: from A(10,0) to C(-5,-5√3): √[(15)² + (5√3)²] = same as AB → 10√3 — good.\n\nSo, triangle ABC has vertices:\n\n- A: (10, 0)\n- B: (-5, 5√3)\n- C: (-5, -5√3)\n\nCenter O1: (0,0)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find points of tangency D, E, F\n\nThe incircle is centered at O1(0,0) with radius 5.\n\nPoints D, E, F are points where incircle touches sides AB, BC, AC respectively.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides lie at the **midpoints** of the sides.\n\nWhy? Because in an equilateral triangle, the incenter coincides with centroid, and the perpendicular from incenter to a side hits the midpoint (due to symmetry).\n\nSo:\n\n- D = midpoint of AB\n- E = midpoint of BC\n- F = midpoint of AC\n\nLet’s compute coordinates.\n\n**D = midpoint of AB:**\n\nA(10,0), B(-5,5√3)\n\nD_x = (10 + (-5)) / 2 = 5/2 = 2.5\n\nD_y = (0 + 5√3)/2 = (5√3)/2\n\nSo, D: (2.5, (5√3)/2)\n\n**E = midpoint of BC:**\n\nB(-5,5√3), C(-5,-5√3)\n\nE_x = (-5 + (-5))/2 = -5\n\nE_y = (5√3 + (-5√3))/2 = 0\n\nSo, E: (-5, 0)\n\n**F = midpoint of AC:**\n\nA(10,0), C(-5,-5√3)\n\nF_x = (10 + (-5))/2 = 2.5\n\nF_y = (0 + (-5√3))/2 = - (5√3)/2\n\nSo, F: (2.5, - (5√3)/2)\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Find equation of line DE\n\nWe have:\n\n- D: (2.5, (5√3)/2)\n- E: (-5, 0)\n\nLet’s find the parametric or slope-intercept form of line DE.\n\nFirst, compute slope m:\n\nm = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (0 - (5√3)/2) / (-5 - 2.5) = [ - (5√3)/2 ] / (-7.5)\n\nSimplify:\n\n-7.5 = -15/2\n\nSo,\n\nm = [ - (5√3)/2 ] / [ -15/2 ] = (5√3)/2 * 2/15 = (5√3)/15 = √3 / 3\n\nSo slope = √3 / 3\n\nNow, equation using point E(-5, 0):\n\ny - 0 = (√3 / 3)(x + 5)\n\nSo, line DE: y = (√3 / 3)(x + 5)\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Find where this line intersects the large circle again (besides E)\n\nThe large circle has center (0,0), radius 10 → equation: x² + y² = 100\n\nWe want to find intersection points of line y = (√3 / 3)(x + 5) with circle x² + y² = 100.\n\nSubstitute y into circle equation:\n\nx² + [ (√3 / 3)(x + 5) ]² = 100\n\nCompute:\n\n[ (√3 / 3)(x + 5) ]² = (3 / 9)(x + 5)² = (1/3)(x + 5)²\n\nSo:\n\nx² + (1/3)(x + 5)² = 100\n\nMultiply both sides by 3 to eliminate denominator:\n\n3x² + (x + 5)² = 300\n\nExpand (x + 5)² = x² + 10x + 25\n\nSo:\n\n3x² + x² + 10x + 25 = 300\n\n→ 4x² + 10x + 25 = 300\n\n→ 4x² + 10x - 275 = 0\n\nDivide entire equation by 2 to simplify:\n\n2x² + 5x - 137.5 = 0\n\nWait — better to keep integers.\n\nOriginal: 4x² + 10x - 275 = 0\n\nLet’s solve using quadratic formula.\n\nx = [ -10 ± √(10² - 4*4*(-275)) ] / (2*4)\n\n= [ -10 ± √(100 + 4400) ] / 8\n\n= [ -10 ± √4500 ] / 8\n\nSimplify √4500:\n\n4500 = 100 * 45 = 100 * 9 * 5 = 900 * 5 → √4500 = 30√5\n\nWait, 30² = 900, 900 * 5 = 4500 → yes.\n\nSo:\n\nx = [ -10 ± 30√5 ] / 8\n\nSimplify:\n\nx = [ -5 ± 15√5 ] / 4\n\nSo two solutions:\n\nx1 = [ -5 + 15√5 ] / 4\n\nx2 = [ -5 - 15√5 ] / 4\n\nWe know that point E(-5, 0) lies on this line and on the circle? Wait — does E lie on the large circle?\n\nE is (-5, 0) → distance from O1(0,0) is √[(-5)^2 + 0^2] = 5 → which is the **inradius**, not circumradius.\n\nSo E is **inside** the large circle — it’s on the incircle, not circumcircle.\n\nWait — this contradicts the problem statement.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n> “Extend segment DE to intersect the large circle again at point B”\n\nSo, DE is a segment from D (on AB) to E (on BC). When extended, it should pass through B and intersect the large circle again at B.\n\nBut according to our coordinates, point B is (-5, 5√3), and E is (-5, 0). So the line DE — does it pass through B?\n\nLet’s check if point B(-5, 5√3) lies on line DE: y = (√3 / 3)(x + 5)\n\nPlug x = -5:\n\ny = (√3 / 3)(0) = 0 → but B has y = 5√3 ≠ 0 → so B is **not** on line DE.\n\nThis is a **problem**.\n\nWait — this suggests a **misunderstanding**.\n\nLet me re-read the problem:\n\n> “Extend segment DE to intersect the large circle again at point B (noting that B is also a vertex of the triangle).”\n\nSo, according to the problem, when we extend DE, it passes through B and intersects the large circle at B.\n\nBut in our coordinate setup, DE does **not** pass through B.\n\nThat means our assumption that D and E are midpoints might be wrong? But in an equilateral triangle, the incircle touches the sides at their midpoints — that’s correct.\n\nWait — perhaps the diagram is not drawn to scale, or I misinterpreted the positions.\n\nLet me double-check: in an equilateral triangle, the incircle touches the sides at their midpoints — yes, because of symmetry.\n\nSo D is midpoint of AB, E is midpoint of BC.\n\nThen line DE connects midpoint of AB to midpoint of BC.\n\nIn triangle ABC, with A(10,0), B(-5,5√3), C(-5,-5√3)\n\nMidpoint D of AB: ((10-5)/2, (0+5√3)/2) = (2.5, 2.5√3) — wait, earlier I said (2.5, (5√3)/2) — which is same as (2.5, 2.5√3) — yes.\n\nE: midpoint of BC: (-5, 0)\n\nSo line DE: from (2.5, 2.5√3) to (-5, 0)\n\nLet’s find if this line passes through B(-5, 5√3)? No, because at x=-5, y=0 for E, but B is at y=5√3.\n\nSo line DE does not pass through B.\n\nBut the problem says: “Extend segment DE to intersect the large circle again at point B”\n\nThis implies that B lies on line DE.\n\nContradiction.\n\nUnless... perhaps the labeling is different.\n\nMaybe point D is on AB, E on BC, but when we extend DE, it intersects the large circle at B — meaning B is the second intersection point of line DE with the large circle.\n\nBut in our calculation, line DE intersects the large circle at two points: one is not E (since E is inside), and the other is some point.\n\nBut the problem says it intersects again at B — so B must be on line DE.\n\nBut in our coordinate system, it's not.\n\nThis suggests that either:\n\n1. Our coordinate placement is incorrect, or\n\n2. The triangle is oriented differently.\n\nPerhaps I placed the triangle incorrectly.\n\nLet me try a different orientation.\n\n---\n\n### Alternative approach: Use geometry without coordinates\n\nLet’s forget coordinates for a moment.\n\nWe have an equilateral triangle ABC, circumradius R = 10, inradius r = 5.\n\nPoints D, E, F are points of tangency of incircle with sides AB, BC, CA respectively.\n\nIn equilateral triangle, D, E, F are midpoints.\n\nSo, DE is the line joining midpoints of AB and BC.\n\nIn triangle ABC, the line joining midpoints of AB and BC is parallel to AC and half its length? No.\n\nActually, in triangle ABC, the line joining midpoints of AB and BC is not a midline in the usual sense.\n\nLet’s consider vector geometry or properties.\n\nIn triangle ABC, let M be midpoint of AB, N be midpoint of BC.\n\nThen vector MN = vector NB + vector BM? Better to use section formula.\n\nActually, in any triangle, the line joining midpoints of two sides is parallel to the third side and half as long — but only if you join midpoints of two sides that share a common vertex? No.\n\nStandard midline theorem: the segment joining midpoints of two sides is parallel to the third side and half its length.\n\nSo, in triangle ABC, if D is midpoint of AB, E is midpoint of BC, then DE is parallel to AC and DE = AC / 2.\n\nIs that true?\n\nLet’s see: in triangle ABC, consider points D (mid AB), E (mid BC).\n\nThen, in triangle ABC, the line DE connects midpoints of AB and BC.\n\nThis is not the standard midline. The standard midline is between midpoints of AB and AC, which is parallel to BC.\n\nHere, D and E are midpoints of AB and BC — so they are not on the same \"side\" from a vertex.\n\nActually, let's use vector geometry.\n\nLet O be the origin (center).\n\nLet’s denote position vectors.\n\nLet’s assume O is centroid.\n\nIn equilateral triangle, centroid = circumcenter = incenter.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\nLet vector OA = **a**, OB = **b**, OC = **c**\n\nSince it's equilateral and centered at origin, we have **a** + **b** + **c** = 0 (centroid at origin).\n\nAlso, |**a**| = |**b**| = |**c**| = R = 10.\n\nD is midpoint of AB → position vector (**a** + **b**)/2\n\nE is midpoint of BC → position vector (**b** + **c**)/2\n\nThen vector DE = E - D = [ (**b** + **c**)/2 ] - [ (**a** + **b**)/2 ] = ( **c** - **a** ) / 2\n\nSo DE is parallel to AC (since AC = **c** - **a**), and half its length.\n\nSo DE || AC and |DE| = |AC| / 2 = s/2 = (10√3)/2 = 5√3\n\nNow, the line DE is parallel to AC.\n\nNow, we are to extend DE to intersect the large circle again at B.\n\nBut B is a vertex, and DE is parallel to AC — in an equilateral triangle, AC is a side, and B is not on any line parallel to AC unless it's at infinity.\n\nSo how can DE extended pass through B?\n\nUnless... perhaps the problem has a typo, or I misread.\n\nLet me read the problem again:\n\n> \"Extend segment DE to intersect the large circle again at point B (noting that B is also a vertex of the triangle).\"\n\nThis suggests that B is on the line DE.\n\nBut from above, DE is parallel to AC, and B is not on any line parallel to AC unless the triangle is degenerate.\n\nThis is impossible in a non-degenerate equilateral triangle.\n\nUnless... perhaps \"extend DE to intersect the large circle again at point B\" means that when you extend DE, it intersects the large circle at two points: one is say P, and the other is B.\n\nBut in our earlier coordinate calculation, we found that line DE intersects the large circle at two points, and neither is B.\n\nPerhaps the point B in the problem is not the vertex B, but another point? But it says \"point B (noting that B is also a vertex of the triangle)\".\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps the diagram is different.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps D is on AB, E on BC, but when we extend DE, it intersects the large circle at B, which is not the same as the vertex B? But the problem says \"B is also a vertex\".\n\nLet's look back at the diagram description.\n\nThe user provided a diagram with points A, B, C on the large circle, D on AB, E on BC, F on AC, O1 center, and DE extended to B.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, B is not the vertex, but the problem says \"B is also a vertex\".\n\nPerhaps there is a mislabeling.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"extend DE to intersect the large circle again at point B\" means that DE is a chord of the large circle, and when extended, it meets the circle at B, but D and E are on the incircle, not on the large circle.\n\nIn our calculation, D and E are at distance 5 from O1, so on the incircle, not on the large circle.\n\nSo line DE is a line inside the large circle, and when extended, it intersects the large circle at two points.\n\nThe problem says it intersects again at B, implying that one intersection point is D or E, but D and E are not on the large circle.\n\nSo perhaps \"again\" means besides some other point.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nPerhaps the problem means that DE is extended to intersect the large circle at a point, and that point is called B, but B is also a vertex — so it must be that the line DE passes through vertex B.\n\nBut in equilateral triangle, with D and E midpoints, it doesn't.\n\nUnless the triangle is not equilateral? But the problem says it is.\n\nPerhaps \"equilateral\" is a mistake, but unlikely.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps \"extend DE to intersect the large circle again at point B\" and B is the vertex, but in the diagram, the line DE does pass through B if we consider the correct configuration.\n\nLet me try to calculate the distance from B to D directly, assuming that B, D, E are colinear.\n\nBut from earlier, in coordinates, B(-5,5√3), D(2.5, 2.5√3), E(-5,0)\n\nLet me check if B, D, E are colinear.\n\nVector BD = D - B = (2.5 - (-5), 2.5√3 - 5√3) = (7.5, -2.5√3)\n\nVector BE = E - B = (-5 - (-5), 0 - 5√3) = (0, -5√3)\n\nAre BD and BE parallel? BD = (7.5, -2.5√3), BE = (0, -5√3)\n\nFor parallel, the ratio of components should be equal.\n\n7.5 / 0 is undefined, so not parallel unless 7.5=0, which is not.\n\nSo not colinear.\n\nPerhaps the point is that when we extend DE, it intersects the large circle at B, but B is not the vertex B, but the problem says it is.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem or in my understanding.\n\nPerhaps \"point B\" in \"intersect at point B\" is not the vertex B, but the problem explicitly says \"B is also a vertex\".\n\nLet's look at the diagram description: \"Segment DE is drawn connecting the points of tangency on sides AB and BC. Extend segment DE to intersect the large circle again at point B\"\n\nSo, DE is from D on AB to E on BC. When extended, it hits the large circle at B, which is a vertex.\n\nIn a standard equilateral triangle, this only happens if D and E are not midpoints, but that contradicts the incircle tangency.\n\nUnless the incircle is not tangent at midpoints, but in equilateral triangle, it is.\n\nPerhaps the triangle is not equilateral? But the problem says it is.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"concentric\" is misinterpreted, but no.\n\nPerhaps the large circle is not the circumcircle, but the problem says \"circumscribes\" so it is.\n\nLet's try to calculate the length DB assuming that B, D, E are colinear, and find the distance.\n\nBut from coordinates, they are not.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, the point B is not the vertex, but the problem says it is.\n\nI think there might be a typo in the problem.\n\nPerhaps \"extend DE to intersect the large circle again at point A\" or \"C\", but it says B.\n\nLet's calculate the distance from D to B in our coordinate system, even if not on the line, but the problem asks for DB, and if B is vertex, then we can calculate it.\n\nIn our coordinate system:\n\nD: (2.5, 2.5√3) = (5/2, 5√3/2)\n\nB: (-5, 5√3)\n\nSo DB = distance = √[ (5/2 - (-5))² + (5√3/2 - 5√3)² ] = √[ (5/2 + 5)² + (5√3/2 - 10√3/2)² ] = √[ (15/2)² + (-5√3/2)² ] = √[ 225/4 + 75/4 ] = √[300/4] = √75 = 5√3\n\nSo DB = 5√3\n\nAnd since the side length is 10√3, and D is midpoint of AB, then DB should be half of AB if B is the end, but AB = 10√3, so from A to B, D is midpoint, so AD = DB = 5√3.\n\nOh! So in the triangle, since D is midpoint of AB, then DB = AB / 2 = 10√3 / 2 = 5√3.\n\nAnd the problem asks for DB, which is simply the distance from D to B, which is half the side length.\n\nAnd the part about extending DE to intersect at B might be redundant or misleading, or perhaps in the diagram, it does intersect, but in our calculation, it doesn't, but the distance DB is still 5√3.\n\nPerhaps the \"extend DE to intersect at B\" is to emphasize that B is on the line, but in reality, for the purpose of finding DB, we don't need that.\n\nAnd since D is on AB, and B is endpoint, DB is just the distance along AB from D to B, which is half the side.\n\nSo, regardless of the line DE, the length DB is 5√3.\n\nAnd the answer should be 5√3.\n\nPerhaps the problem is testing if we realize that D is midpoint, so DB = s/2 = 5√3.\n\nAnd the part about extending DE to B is either a red herring or based on a different diagram.\n\nIn many geometry problems, even if the diagram is misleading, the text defines the points.\n\nHere, D is on AB, E on BC, and we need DB.\n\nSince D is point of tangency of incircle with AB, and in equilateral triangle, it is the midpoint, so DB = AB/2 = 5√3.\n\nSo I think the answer is 5√3.\n\nLet me box that.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}}"
