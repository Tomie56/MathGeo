    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric regular hexagons centered at O1:\n\n- The **outer hexagon** has side length 5 and is rotated by π/6 radians (30 degrees).\n- The **inner hexagon** is scaled down by 1/2 (so side length = 2.5) and shares the same center O1.\n- We are to find the distance between point **I** (a vertex of the inner hexagon) and **M_0**, the midpoint of side **DE** of the outer hexagon.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nA regular hexagon can be inscribed in a circle, with all vertices lying on a circle centered at O1. The distance from the center to any vertex (the radius) equals the side length.\n\nSo:\n\n- Outer hexagon: radius = 5\n- Inner hexagon: radius = 2.5\n\nThe outer hexagon is rotated by π/6 radians. That means its vertices are not aligned with the x- and y-axes, but rotated 30 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nWe are to find the distance between:\n\n- **I**: a vertex of the inner hexagon\n- **M_0**: midpoint of side DE of the outer hexagon\n\nWe need to assign coordinates to these points.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Set up a coordinate system\n\nLet’s place the center O1 at the origin: (0, 0).\n\nWe’ll label the vertices of the outer hexagon as A, B, C, D, E, F in counterclockwise order, starting from the rightmost vertex (which, due to the π/6 rotation, will not be on the x-axis).\n\nBut since the hexagon is rotated by π/6, we need to compute the positions accordingly.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Coordinates of outer hexagon vertices\n\nIn a regular hexagon centered at origin, the vertices are at angles:\n\nθ_k = θ₀ + k * π/3, for k = 0 to 5\n\nSince the hexagon is rotated by π/6, we set θ₀ = π/6.\n\nSo the vertices of the **outer hexagon** are at:\n\nP_k = (5 * cos(π/6 + k * π/3), 5 * sin(π/6 + k * π/3)) for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\nLet’s compute them:\n\n### k = 0 → point A:\nθ = π/6  \nx = 5 * cos(π/6) = 5 * (√3/2) = (5√3)/2  \ny = 5 * sin(π/6) = 5 * (1/2) = 2.5  \n→ A = ( (5√3)/2 , 2.5 )\n\n### k = 1 → point B:\nθ = π/6 + π/3 = π/2  \nx = 5 * cos(π/2) = 0  \ny = 5 * sin(π/2) = 5  \n→ B = (0, 5)\n\n### k = 2 → point C:\nθ = π/6 + 2π/3 = 5π/6  \nx = 5 * cos(5π/6) = 5 * (-√3/2) = - (5√3)/2  \ny = 5 * sin(5π/6) = 5 * (1/2) = 2.5  \n→ C = ( - (5√3)/2 , 2.5 )\n\n### k = 3 → point D:\nθ = π/6 + π = 7π/6  \nx = 5 * cos(7π/6) = 5 * (-√3/2) = - (5√3)/2  \ny = 5 * sin(7π/6) = 5 * (-1/2) = -2.5  \n→ D = ( - (5√3)/2 , -2.5 )\n\n### k = 4 → point E:\nθ = π/6 + 4π/3 = 9π/6 = 3π/2  \nx = 5 * cos(3π/2) = 0  \ny = 5 * sin(3π/2) = -5  \n→ E = (0, -5)\n\n### k = 5 → point F:\nθ = π/6 + 5π/3 = 11π/6  \nx = 5 * cos(11π/6) = 5 * (√3/2) = (5√3)/2  \ny = 5 * sin(11π/6) = 5 * (-1/2) = -2.5  \n→ F = ( (5√3)/2 , -2.5 )\n\nSo we have:\n\n- A: (5√3/2, 2.5)\n- B: (0, 5)\n- C: (-5√3/2, 2.5)\n- D: (-5√3/2, -2.5)\n- E: (0, -5)\n- F: (5√3/2, -2.5)\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Find M_0, the midpoint of side DE\n\nPoints D and E:\n\nD = (-5√3/2, -2.5)  \nE = (0, -5)\n\nMidpoint M_0 = ( (x_D + x_E)/2 , (y_D + y_E)/2 )\n\nx = (-5√3/2 + 0)/2 = -5√3/4  \ny = (-2.5 + (-5))/2 = (-7.5)/2 = -3.75\n\nSo M_0 = ( -5√3/4 , -15/4 )  [since 3.75 = 15/4]\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Coordinates of inner hexagon vertices\n\nThe inner hexagon is scaled by 1/2 and concentric, so its vertices are at half the radius: 2.5, same angles.\n\nVertices of inner hexagon: let’s label them G, H, I, J, K, L (as shown in the diagram).\n\nAssuming the same labeling order (counterclockwise), and same rotation (π/6), then:\n\nVertex I corresponds to k = 2 (same as outer vertex C), since in the diagram, I is on the left side, same as C.\n\nWait — let’s check the diagram description:\n\nIn the diagram, the inner hexagon has vertices labeled: H, G, L, K, M_0? Wait — no, M_0 is midpoint of DE, not a vertex.\n\nLooking at the diagram description: the inner hexagon has vertices H, G, L, K, and then I and J? The diagram says:\n\n- Outer: A, B, C, D, E, F\n- Inner: H, G, L, K, and then I and J? From the diagram: I is connected to J and to the point below (which is L?).\n\nActually, from the diagram, the inner hexagon is labeled: H, G, L, K, J, I — in counterclockwise order? Let’s assume the same angular positions as the outer hexagon.\n\nSo vertex I of the inner hexagon corresponds to the same angle as vertex C of the outer hexagon? Let’s check:\n\nOuter vertex C is at angle 5π/6.\n\nInner vertex I — from the diagram, it’s on the left side, same as C, so likely at same angle.\n\nSo:\n\nVertex I (inner) = (2.5 * cos(5π/6), 2.5 * sin(5π/6))\n\ncos(5π/6) = -√3/2  \nsin(5π/6) = 1/2\n\nSo:\n\nx = 2.5 * (-√3/2) = - (5√3)/4  \ny = 2.5 * (1/2) = 1.25 = 5/4\n\n→ I = ( -5√3/4 , 5/4 )\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Compute distance between I and M_0\n\nI = ( -5√3/4 , 5/4 )  \nM_0 = ( -5√3/4 , -15/4 )\n\nNotice: **x-coordinates are the same!**\n\nSo the distance is purely vertical:\n\nΔy = y_M0 - y_I = (-15/4) - (5/4) = -20/4 = -5\n\nDistance = |Δy| = 5\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{5}\n$$\n\nThe length of segment IM_0 is **5 units**."
