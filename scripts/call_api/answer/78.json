  "answer": [
    "We are given a geometric construction involving two congruent equilateral triangles. The first triangle is centered at O1, has side length 1, and is rotated by π/3 radians. The second triangle is formed by translating the first perpendicularly relative to one of its sides, and is centered at O2. There are 8 labeled points and 8 line segments. Points M₀ and M₁ are midpoints of segments L₄ and L₀, respectively, and we are to find the length of segment M₀M₁.\n\n---\n\nLet’s proceed step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup\n\nWe are told:\n\n- Two **congruent equilateral triangles**.\n- The first is centered at O1, side length = 1, rotated by π/3.\n- The second is obtained by **translating the first perpendicularly relative to a side**.\n- Total 8 labeled points: A, B, C, D, E, F, M₀, M₁ (and possibly L₃, L₄, O1, O2 — but these are not vertices, they are midpoints or centers).\n- M₀ = midpoint of L₄\n- M₁ = midpoint of L₀\n- We need to compute distance M₀M₁.\n\nBut we are not given coordinates. So we must **assign coordinates** to make this concrete.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Place the first triangle in the plane\n\nLet’s place the first equilateral triangle (centered at O1) with side length 1, rotated by π/3.\n\nBut note: **rotation by π/3** — this is ambiguous without knowing the axis or reference. However, since it’s a 2D plane and we’re dealing with equilateral triangles, likely the triangle is rotated so that one side is not horizontal.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle is rotated so that its orientation is such that a vertex points upward, but rotated π/3 from standard position? Let’s assume standard position first and then rotate.\n\nActually, to make this manageable, let’s **define the first triangle without rotation first**, then apply rotation.\n\nBut the problem says “rotated by π/3 radians” — perhaps this is the rotation of the triangle itself, not the translation. Let’s interpret it as: the triangle is oriented at an angle of π/3 relative to the horizontal.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the triangle is placed with one side horizontal, and then rotated π/3 — but that would make it non-standard.\n\nActually, let’s try a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use symmetry and vector geometry\n\nSince both triangles are congruent equilateral triangles of side length 1, and one is translated perpendicularly relative to a side of the other, we can model this as follows:\n\nLet’s assume the first triangle has vertices A, B, C.\n\nLet’s place triangle ABC such that:\n\n- Point B is at (0, 0)\n- Point C is at (1, 0) → so side BC is horizontal\n- Since it’s equilateral, point A is at (0.5, √3/2)\n\nBut the problem says the triangle is **rotated by π/3 radians**. So perhaps we rotate this triangle by π/3.\n\nWait — if we rotate the triangle by π/3, then the side that was horizontal is now at angle π/3.\n\nBut the problem also says: “one is translated perpendicularly relative to a side of the other”.\n\nSo perhaps after rotating the first triangle by π/3, we translate it perpendicular to one of its sides to get the second triangle.\n\nLet’s define:\n\nLet’s place the first triangle (centered at O1) with side length 1, rotated by π/3.\n\nLet’s define the triangle with vertices:\n\nLet’s let one side be from point P to Q, and the third vertex R.\n\nTo make it rotated by π/3, let’s define the triangle with one side along the direction of angle π/3.\n\nSo, let’s define:\n\nLet’s let vertex B be at (0, 0)\n\nVertex C be at (cos(π/3), sin(π/3)) = (0.5, √3/2)\n\nBut then the side BC has length 1, and is at angle π/3.\n\nThen the third vertex A should be such that triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nTo find A, we can rotate point C around B by 60 degrees (π/3) — but wait, if we already have BC at angle π/3, and we want equilateral triangle, then A can be found by rotating vector BC by 60 degrees around B.\n\nVector BC = (0.5, √3/2)\n\nRotating this vector by 60 degrees (π/3) counterclockwise around B:\n\nRotation matrix: [cosθ -sinθ; sinθ cosθ] with θ = π/3\n\ncos(π/3) = 0.5, sin(π/3) = √3/2\n\nSo rotated vector:\n\nx' = 0.5 * 0.5 - (√3/2) * (√3/2) = 0.25 - 3/4 = -0.5\n\ny' = 0.5 * (√3/2) + (√3/2) * 0.5 = √3/4 + √3/4 = √3/2\n\nSo point A = B + rotated vector = (0,0) + (-0.5, √3/2) = (-0.5, √3/2)\n\nSo triangle ABC has vertices:\n\n- B: (0, 0)\n- C: (0.5, √3/2)\n- A: (-0.5, √3/2)\n\nLet’s verify side lengths:\n\nAB: from (-0.5, √3/2) to (0,0):\n\ndx = 0.5, dy = -√3/2 → length = √(0.25 + 0.75) = √1 = 1\n\nBC: from (0,0) to (0.5, √3/2): same as above, length 1\n\nAC: from (-0.5, √3/2) to (0.5, √3/2): dx=1, dy=0 → length 1\n\nGood.\n\nNow, the center O1 of the triangle: centroid = average of vertices:\n\nO1_x = (-0.5 + 0 + 0.5)/3 = 0/3 = 0\n\nO1_y = (√3/2 + 0 + √3/2)/3 = (√3)/3 = √3/3\n\nSo O1 = (0, √3/3)\n\nNow, we translate this triangle perpendicularly relative to a side to get the second triangle.\n\nWhich side? The problem doesn’t specify, but likely it’s translated perpendicular to side BC or AB or AC.\n\nLooking at the diagram labels: points A, B, C, D, E, F, M₀, M₁, and also L₃, L₄, O1, O2.\n\nFrom the diagram description, it seems that the two triangles share a common vertex or side? Or are adjacent.\n\nBut the problem says: “translated perpendicularly relative to a side of the other”.\n\nSo, let’s assume we translate the first triangle perpendicular to side BC.\n\nSide BC is from B(0,0) to C(0.5, √3/2). The direction vector is (0.5, √3/2), which has angle π/3 with x-axis.\n\nA perpendicular vector would be (-√3/2, 0.5) or (√3/2, -0.5) — let’s take the one pointing “outward” or in a consistent direction.\n\nThe length of translation: since it’s a translation to form a second congruent triangle, and we want to end up with 8 labeled points, likely the translation is such that the second triangle is adjacent, sharing no vertices, but perhaps sharing a midpoint or something.\n\nBut the problem says: “after one round of translation, a second triangle (centered at O2) is formed”.\n\nAnd we have points D, E, F for the second triangle.\n\nAlso, M₀ and M₁ are midpoints of L₄ and L₀.\n\nLooking at the diagram labels: L₃, L₄ are likely segments connecting the two triangles.\n\nPerhaps L₀ is a side of the first triangle, L₄ is a side of the second, and M₀, M₁ are their midpoints.\n\nBut without the diagram, we have to infer.\n\nAnother approach: since both triangles are equilateral, side length 1, and one is translated perpendicularly relative to a side, the distance between centers O1 and O2 should be the height of the equilateral triangle, because translating perpendicularly to a side by the height would place the second triangle such that it shares a side or is adjacent.\n\nWait, if you translate an equilateral triangle perpendicularly to one of its sides by a distance equal to its height, you get a position where the two triangles form a rhombus or a parallelogram.\n\nThe height of an equilateral triangle of side 1 is h = √3/2.\n\nSo if we translate the first triangle by vector perpendicular to side BC by distance h, we get the second triangle.\n\nLet’s do that.\n\nFirst, find a unit vector perpendicular to BC.\n\nVector BC = (0.5, √3/2), magnitude = 1 (since side length 1).\n\nA perpendicular vector is (-√3/2, 0.5) — let’s check dot product:\n\n(0.5)(-√3/2) + (√3/2)(0.5) = -√3/4 + √3/4 = 0, good.\n\nAnd magnitude: √[ (√3/2)^2 + (0.5)^2 ] = √[3/4 + 1/4] = √1 = 1, so it's a unit vector.\n\nSo to translate perpendicularly, we can use this vector or its negative.\n\nLet’s assume we translate in the direction of (-√3/2, 0.5) — which is 90 degrees counterclockwise from BC.\n\nBut let’s see what that does.\n\nTranslate each vertex of triangle ABC by vector V = (-√3/2, 0.5) to get triangle DEF.\n\nSo:\n\nD = A + V = (-0.5, √3/2) + (-√3/2, 0.5) = (-0.5 - √3/2, √3/2 + 0.5)\n\nE = B + V = (0,0) + (-√3/2, 0.5) = (-√3/2, 0.5)\n\nF = C + V = (0.5, √3/2) + (-√3/2, 0.5) = (0.5 - √3/2, √3/2 + 0.5)\n\nNow, the center O2 of the second triangle is O1 + V = (0, √3/3) + (-√3/2, 0.5) = (-√3/2, √3/3 + 0.5)\n\nNow, we have all points.\n\nBut we need to identify segments L₀ and L₄.\n\nThe problem says: \"Points M₀ and M₁ are defined as the midpoints of segments L₄ and L₀, respectively.\"\n\nAnd from the diagram, likely L₀ is a side of the first triangle, L₄ is a side of the second, or perhaps they are connecting segments.\n\nLooking at the labels: in the diagram, there are points A,B,C,D,E,F, and also L3, L4, M0, M1.\n\nFrom the way it's drawn, likely L0 is side AB or BC or AC, and L4 is a corresponding side in the second triangle.\n\nBut M0 and M1 are midpoints, and we need distance between them.\n\nPerhaps L0 is side BC of first triangle, L4 is side EF of second triangle, or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the segments L0, L3, L4 are the segments connecting the two triangles.\n\nFor example, from B to E, or C to F, etc.\n\nLet’s look at the points:\n\nFirst triangle: A(-0.5, √3/2), B(0,0), C(0.5, √3/2)\n\nSecond triangle: D(-0.5 - √3/2, √3/2 + 0.5), E(-√3/2, 0.5), F(0.5 - √3/2, √3/2 + 0.5)\n\nNow, let’s compute midpoints of some segments.\n\nPerhaps M1 is midpoint of L0, and L0 is side AB of first triangle.\n\nSide AB: from A(-0.5, √3/2) to B(0,0)\n\nMidpoint M1 = [ (-0.5+0)/2, (√3/2 + 0)/2 ] = (-0.25, √3/4)\n\nSimilarly, M0 is midpoint of L4. What is L4? Perhaps side DE or EF or FD.\n\nLet’s assume L4 is side EF of second triangle.\n\nE(-√3/2, 0.5), F(0.5 - √3/2, √3/2 + 0.5)\n\nMidpoint M0 = [ (-√3/2 + 0.5 - √3/2)/2, (0.5 + √3/2 + 0.5)/2 ] = [ (0.5 - √3)/2, (1 + √3/2)/2 ] = (0.25 - √3/2, 0.5 + √3/4)\n\nLet’s calculate:\n\nx_m0 = [ -√3/2 + 0.5 - √3/2 ] / 2 = [0.5 - √3] / 2 = 0.25 - √3/2\n\ny_m0 = [0.5 + (√3/2 + 0.5)] / 2 = [1 + √3/2] / 2 = 0.5 + √3/4\n\nNow M1 = (-0.25, √3/4)\n\nNow distance M0M1:\n\ndx = x_m0 - x_m1 = (0.25 - √3/2) - (-0.25) = 0.25 - √3/2 + 0.25 = 0.5 - √3/2\n\ndy = y_m0 - y_m1 = (0.5 + √3/4) - (√3/4) = 0.5\n\nSo distance = √[ (0.5 - √3/2)^2 + (0.5)^2 ]\n\nCompute:\n\nFirst, (0.5 - √3/2)^2 = (1/2 - √3/2)^2 = [(1 - √3)/2]^2 = (1 - 2√3 + 3)/4 = (4 - 2√3)/4? Wait no:\n\n(1 - √3)^2 = 1 - 2√3 + 3 = 4 - 2√3? No:\n\n(1 - √3)^2 = 1 - 2√3 + (√3)^2 = 1 - 2√3 + 3 = 4 - 2√3\n\nThen divided by 4: (4 - 2√3)/4 = 1 - √3/2\n\nBut that's not right because (a-b)^2 = a^2 -2ab +b^2, so:\n\n(0.5 - √3/2)^2 = (1/2)^2 - 2*(1/2)*(√3/2) + (√3/2)^2 = 1/4 - (√3/2) + 3/4 = (1/4 + 3/4) - √3/2 = 1 - √3/2\n\nThen (0.5)^2 = 0.25\n\nSo total = 1 - √3/2 + 0.25 = 1.25 - √3/2\n\nBut this is not a number, and it should be a length, but we can compute numerically.\n\n√3 ≈ 1.732, so √3/2 ≈ 0.866\n\nSo 1.25 - 0.866 = 0.384, then sqrt(0.384) ≈ 0.62, but this seems small, and also we have a mistake because the expression is:\n\ndistance^2 = (0.5 - √3/2)^2 + (0.5)^2 = [1 - √3/2] + 0.25? No:\n\nFrom above:\n\n(0.5 - √3/2)^2 = 1/4 - 2*(1/2)*(√3/2) + (3/4) = 1/4 - √3/2 + 3/4 = (1/4 + 3/4) - √3/2 = 1 - √3/2\n\nThen plus (0.5)^2 = 0.25, so total distance^2 = 1 - √3/2 + 0.25 = 1.25 - √3/2\n\nBut 1.25 - 0.866 = 0.384, sqrt(0.384) ≈ 0.62, but let's keep symbolic.\n\ndistance^2 = (0.5 - √3/2)^2 + (0.5)^2 = (1/2 - √3/2)^2 + (1/2)^2 = [(1 - √3)/2]^2 + (1/2)^2 = (1 - 2√3 + 3)/4 + 1/4 = (4 - 2√3)/4 + 1/4 = (4 - 2√3 + 1)/4 = (5 - 2√3)/4\n\nSo distance = √[(5 - 2√3)/4] = (1/2) √(5 - 2√3)\n\nThis is a possible answer, but let's see if it simplifies.\n\n5 - 2√3 ≈ 5 - 3.464 = 1.536, sqrt(1.536) ≈ 1.24, divided by 2 ≈ 0.62, same as before.\n\nBut is this correct? We assumed L0 is AB and L4 is EF.\n\nBut in the diagram, M0 and M1 are likely midpoints of segments that are corresponding or connecting.\n\nPerhaps L0 is BC and L4 is EF or something else.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the segments L0 and L4 are the segments connecting the two triangles, like from B to E or C to F.\n\nLet’s look at the points:\n\nB(0,0), E(-√3/2, 0.5) — this is the translation vector, so BE is the translation vector, length 1, since we translated by a unit vector.\n\nSimilarly, C to F: C(0.5, √3/2), F(0.5 - √3/2, √3/2 + 0.5), so vector CF = (-√3/2, 0.5), same as translation vector.\n\nSo if L0 is BE, then midpoint M1 = midpoint of B and E = ((0 - √3/2)/2, (0 + 0.5)/2) = (-√3/4, 0.25)\n\nSimilarly, if L4 is CF, then M0 = midpoint of C and F = ((0.5 + 0.5 - √3/2)/2, (√3/2 + √3/2 + 0.5)/2) = ((1 - √3/2)/2, (√3 + 0.5)/2) = (0.5 - √3/4, √3/2 + 0.25)\n\nThen dx = x_m0 - x_m1 = (0.5 - √3/4) - (-√3/4) = 0.5 - √3/4 + √3/4 = 0.5\n\ndy = y_m0 - y_m1 = (√3/2 + 0.25) - 0.25 = √3/2\n\nSo distance = √(0.5^2 + (√3/2)^2) = √(0.25 + 0.75) = √1 = 1\n\nOh! This is nice.\n\nSo if M1 is midpoint of BE, and M0 is midpoint of CF, then distance is 1.\n\nBut is this what the problem intends?\n\nThe problem says: \"Points M₀ and M₁ are defined as the midpoints of segments L₄ and L₀, respectively.\"\n\nAnd in the diagram, likely L0 and L4 are the segments connecting the corresponding vertices of the two triangles.\n\nSince the second triangle is a translation of the first, the segments connecting corresponding vertices are all equal and parallel to the translation vector.\n\nSo BE, CF, DA are all equal and parallel.\n\nTheir midpoints would form a triangle or something, but the distance between midpoints of two such segments.\n\nIn this case, if L0 is BE, L4 is CF, then M1 = mid BE, M0 = mid CF, and we got distance 1.\n\nBut is there a segment L0 and L4 defined as such?\n\nPerhaps L0 is the segment from B to E, and L4 from C to F.\n\nIn the diagram, there are 8 line segments, likely the 3 sides of each triangle, and 2 connecting segments, but 3+3+2=8, so perhaps.\n\nOr perhaps the 8 segments include the sides and the connections.\n\nBut in any case, with this assumption, we get a clean answer of 1.\n\nMoreover, the problem asks for the length, and 1 is a nice number.\n\nPerhaps this is correct.\n\nTo confirm, let's see what the centers are.\n\nO1 = (0, √3/3) ≈ (0, 0.577)\n\nO2 = O1 + V = (0, √3/3) + (-√3/2, 0.5) = (-√3/2, √3/3 + 0.5) ≈ (-0.866, 0.577 + 0.5) = (-0.866, 1.077)\n\nDistance between O1 and O2 = |V| = 1, since V is unit vector.\n\nNow, the midpoints M1 and M0: if M1 is mid of B and E, B(0,0), E(-√3/2, 0.5), so M1(-√3/4, 0.25)\n\nM0 mid of C and F, C(0.5, √3/2)≈(0.5,0.866), F(0.5 - √3/2, √3/2 + 0.5)≈(0.5-0.866,0.866+0.5)= (-0.366,1.366)\n\nMidpoint M0 = ((0.5 + (-0.366))/2, (0.866 + 1.366)/2) ≈ (0.134/2, 2.232/2) = (0.067, 1.116)\n\nEarlier I calculated exactly: M0 = (0.5 - √3/4, √3/2 + 0.25)\n\n√3/4 ≈ 0.433, so x=0.5-0.433=0.067, y=0.866+0.25=1.116, matches.\n\nM1 = (-√3/4, 0.25) ≈ (-0.433, 0.25)\n\ndx = 0.067 - (-0.433) = 0.5\n\ndy = 1.116 - 0.25 = 0.866 = √3/2\n\nSo distance = √(0.5^2 + (√3/2)^2) = √(0.25 + 0.75) = √1 = 1\n\nPerfect.\n\nNow, is this consistent with the problem? The problem says \"segments L₄ and L₀\", and in the diagram, likely L0 is BE, L4 is CF, or vice versa.\n\nBut since M0 is midpoint of L4, M1 of L0, and we have distance 1, and it's symmetric.\n\nPerhaps L0 is AB, but then we got a messy answer, while this is clean.\n\nMoreover, the problem mentions \"after one round of translation\", and the connecting segments are natural.\n\nAlso, the total 8 labeled points: A,B,C,D,E,F, and M0,M1 — that's 8 points.\n\nThe 8 line segments: probably the 3 sides of first triangle, 3 of second, and 2 connecting segments, like BE and CF, or perhaps all three, but 3+3+3=9, too many.\n\nPerhaps only two connecting segments are drawn.\n\nIn any case, with this interpretation, we get a clean answer.\n\nPerhaps L0 and L4 are the segments from the first triangle to the second, and M0, M1 their midpoints.\n\nAnd since the translation is perpendicular to a side, and we got distance 1, which is the side length, it makes sense.\n\nSo I think the answer is 1.\n\nBut let's see if there's another possibility.\n\nSuppose L0 is side BC of first triangle, L4 is side EF of second triangle.\n\nBC from B(0,0) to C(0.5, √3/2), midpoint M1 = ((0+0.5)/2, (0+√3/2)/2) = (0.25, √3/4)\n\nEF from E(-√3/2, 0.5) to F(0.5 - √3/2, √3/2 + 0.5), midpoint M0 = as before (0.25 - √3/2, 0.5 + √3/4)? Earlier we had for EF midpoint: x = [ -√3/2 + 0.5 - √3/2 ] / 2 = (0.5 - √3)/2 = 0.25 - √3/2\n\ny = [0.5 + √3/2 + 0.5]/2 = (1 + √3/2)/2 = 0.5 + √3/4\n\nThen dx = (0.25 - √3/2) - 0.25 = -√3/2\n\ndy = (0.5 + √3/4) - √3/4 = 0.5\n\nDistance = √[ (-√3/2)^2 + (0.5)^2 ] = √[ 3/4 + 1/4 ] = √1 = 1\n\nSame answer!\n\nOh! So whether we take midpoints of corresponding sides or of connecting segments, we get distance 1.\n\nIn this case, if L0 is BC, L4 is EF, then M1 = mid BC, M0 = mid EF, distance is 1.\n\nSimilarly, if we take any corresponding side, since the second triangle is a translation of the first, the midpoint of a side in the first triangle and the midpoint of the corresponding side in the second triangle are separated by the translation vector, which has length 1.\n\nIs that true?\n\nTranslation vector V = (-√3/2, 0.5), magnitude 1.\n\nThe midpoint of a side in the first triangle, when translated by V, gives the midpoint of the corresponding side in the second triangle.\n\nSo the vector from M1 to M0 is exactly V, so distance is |V| = 1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of which corresponding sides we take, the distance between their midpoints is equal to the translation distance, which is 1.\n\nIn this case, since the translation is by a vector of length 1 (as we used a unit perpendicular vector), the distance is 1.\n\nBut is the translation distance necessarily 1?\n\nThe problem says: \"translated perpendicularly relative to a side\" — but it doesn't specify the distance.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, if you translate perpendicularly to a side, what distance? To form a second triangle, likely the distance is such that the triangles are adjacent, but in this case, since we translated by the height? No, we translated by a unit vector, but the height is √3/2 ≈ 0.866, not 1.\n\nIn our case, we translated by a vector perpendicular to the side, with magnitude 1, but the side length is 1, so the height is √3/2, so if we translate by the height, it would be different.\n\nBut in the problem, it doesn't specify the distance of translation.\n\nHowever, in our construction, we assumed the translation vector is perpendicular and of length 1, but that might not be correct.\n\nLet's rethink.\n\nThe problem says: \"two congruent equilateral triangles are positioned such that one is translated perpendicularly relative to a side of the other.\"\n\nIt doesn't specify the distance, but since they are congruent and positioned, likely the translation is such that the second triangle is adjacent, sharing a side or something, but if you translate perpendicularly to a side, you can't share a side unless you translate by zero.\n\nPerhaps the translation is by the height, so that the two triangles form a rhombus or a parallelogram.\n\nFor example, if you have two equilateral triangles sharing a common side, but that's not translation.\n\nIf you translate one triangle perpendicularly to a side by the height, then the two triangles will have their bases parallel, and the distance between bases is the height.\n\nIn that case, the translation vector would be perpendicular to the side, with length equal to the height, which is √3/2.\n\nBut in that case, the distance between midpoints of corresponding sides would be √3/2.\n\nBut earlier when we assumed translation by 1, we got distance 1, but if translation is by height, it should be √3/2.\n\nBut in our calculation, when we took the perpendicular vector, we used a unit vector, but perhaps we should use the height vector.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nSo, for side BC, vector BC = (0.5, √3/2), magnitude 1.\n\nA perpendicular vector is (-√3/2, 0.5), as before, which has magnitude 1.\n\nBut the height of the triangle is the distance from A to line BC.\n\nIn our triangle, A is at (-0.5, √3/2), line BC from B(0,0) to C(0.5, √3/2).\n\nThe height can be calculated as the distance from A to line BC.\n\nSince it's equilateral, height is √3/2.\n\nThe direction perpendicular to BC is (-√3/2, 0.5), as before.\n\nTo translate by the height, we need a vector in that direction with length √3/2.\n\nSo the translation vector V = (√3/2) * (-√3/2, 0.5) = (-3/4, √3/4)\n\nLet's compute:\n\nMagnitude of (-√3/2, 0.5) is 1, so to have length h = √3/2, multiply by √3/2.\n\nSo V = (√3/2) * (-√3/2, 1/2) = ( -3/4, √3/4 )\n\nThen translate each vertex by V.\n\nSo second triangle:\n\nD = A + V = (-0.5, √3/2) + (-3/4, √3/4) = (-0.5 - 0.75, √3/2 + √3/4) = (-1.25, 3√3/4)\n\nE = B + V = (0,0) + (-3/4, √3/4) = (-0.75, √3/4)\n\nF = C + V = (0.5, √3/2) + (-3/4, √3/4) = (0.5 - 0.75, √3/2 + √3/4) = (-0.25, 3√3/4)\n\nNow, if we take midpoints of corresponding sides.\n\nSay L0 is BC: B(0,0), C(0.5, √3/2), midpoint M1 = (0.25, √3/4)\n\nL4 is EF: E(-0.75, √3/4), F(-0.25, 3√3/4), midpoint M0 = [ (-0.75 + (-0.25))/2, (√3/4 + 3√3/4)/2 ] = [ (-1)/2, (4√3/4)/2 ] = (-0.5, √3/2)\n\nThen distance M0M1 = from (-0.5, √3/2) to (0.25, √3/4)\n\ndx = 0.25 - (-0.5) = 0.75\n\ndy = √3/4 - √3/2 = -√3/4\n\nDistance = √[ (0.75)^2 + (√3/4)^2 ] = √[ 0.5625 + 3/16 ] = √[ 0.5625 + 0.1875 ] = √0.75 = √(3/4) = √3/2\n\nWhich is the height.\n\nBut the problem likely intends the translation to be by a distance such that the segments are connected in a way that M0M1 is to be calculated, and in the first interpretation, we got 1, which is the side length, and it was clean.\n\nMoreover, in the problem, it says \"after one round of translation\", and \"resulting in a total of 8 labeled points and 8 line segments\", which suggests that the two triangles are not overlapping and are connected by segments, and the translation distance might be such that the connecting segments are of length 1 or something.\n\nBut in our first calculation, with translation by unit vector, we got distance 1, and it worked for both interpretations.\n\nPerhaps the \"translated perpendicularly relative to a side\" means that the translation vector is perpendicular to a side and has length equal to the side length, i.e., 1.\n\nThat would make sense for the geometry.\n\nIn many such problems, when they say \"translated perpendicularly\", they mean by a distance equal to the side length, especially if not specified.\n\nMoreover, in the answer, 1 is a nice number.\n\nAdditionally, in the diagram, if you have two equilateral triangles of side 1, translated perpendicularly by distance 1, then the distance between midpoints of corresponding sides is 1, as we calculated.\n\nSo I think the intended answer is 1.\n\nTo confirm, let's see the centers.\n\nO1 = (0, √3/3)\n\nO2 = O1 + V = (0, √3/3) + (-√3/2, 0.5) = (-√3/2, √3/3 + 1/2)\n\nDistance O1O2 = |V| = 1, as before.\n\nNow, the midpoints of corresponding sides are also separated by V, so distance 1.\n\nTherefore, regardless of which corresponding side we take, M0M1 = 1.\n\nSo the length is 1.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{1}\\]"
