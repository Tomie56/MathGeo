    "In the given geometric configuration, two congruent equilateral triangles are positioned such that triangle ABC (centered at O1) is translated perpendicularly along the direction of side BC to form triangle CDE (centered at O2), with point C shared as a vertex. All sides of both triangles have length 1. Points A, B, C, D, E, F, O1, and O2 are labeled as shown, with O1 and O2 being the respective centroids. The translation preserves orientation and results in a symmetric “V”-shaped composite figure.\n\nFind the radian measure of angle ∠BAC, expressed as a multiple of π."

    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two **congruent equilateral triangles**: triangle ABC and triangle CDE. Both have side length 1. Triangle CDE is formed by translating triangle ABC **perpendicularly along the direction of side BC**, with point C shared. The centroids are labeled O1 and O2, and the figure forms a symmetric “V” shape.\n\nWe are asked to find the **radian measure of angle ∠BAC**, expressed as a multiple of π.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the nature of triangle ABC\n\nWe are told that triangle ABC is **equilateral**. In an equilateral triangle, **all interior angles are equal**, and since the sum of angles in any triangle is π radians (180°), each angle must be:\n\n\\[\n\\angle BAC = \\angle ABC = \\angle ACB = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nThis is a standard result.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm that the translation does not affect the internal angles of triangle ABC\n\nThe problem states that triangle CDE is formed by **translating** triangle ABC perpendicularly along the direction of side BC. Translation is a **rigid motion** — it preserves distances and angles. Therefore, triangle CDE is congruent to triangle ABC and also equilateral.\n\nImportantly, **angle ∠BAC is an internal angle of triangle ABC**, which is unchanged by the translation of the triangle to form CDE. The translation moves the whole triangle, but does not alter its internal angles.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Address potential confusion from the “V” shape and point labeling\n\nThe problem mentions points A, B, C, D, E, F, O1, O2. From the description and the implied diagram (even though we can’t see it, the text describes it), triangle ABC is translated to form triangle CDE, sharing vertex C. The “V” shape suggests that the two triangles are adjacent at point C, forming a kind of kite or chevron.\n\nBut **angle ∠BAC** is entirely within triangle ABC. It does not involve points D, E, F, or O2. So the rest of the configuration — including the translation, the second triangle, the centroids, and the “V” shape — is **irrelevant to computing ∠BAC**.\n\nThe question is simply asking for an internal angle of an equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral, each angle is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$**"
