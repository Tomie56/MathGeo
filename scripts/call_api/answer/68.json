    "Let’s carefully analyze the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n**Given:**\n\n- Triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle centered at O1 with radius 5.\n- Point C lies on the circle. (This is redundant since ABC is inscribed, so all points A, B, C lie on the circle.)\n- Line L1 is the line segment AB.\n- A perpendicular is drawn from point C to line L1, meeting L1 at point C.\n- This implies that the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB is point C itself.\n\n---\n\n**Interpretation:**\n\nIf the foot of the perpendicular from point C to line AB is point C, that means point C lies **on** line AB.\n\nWhy? Because the foot of the perpendicular from a point to a line is the point on the line closest to the given point. If that foot is the point itself, then the point must lie on the line.\n\nSo, point C lies on line AB.\n\nBut triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle. If points A, B, and C are all on the circle, and C also lies on line AB, then points A, B, and C are **collinear**.\n\nHowever, if three points on a circle are collinear, they must lie on a **diameter** — because the only straight line that intersects a circle in three distinct points is impossible unless two of them coincide. But here, we have a triangle ABC, which implies three distinct points.\n\nWait — contradiction?\n\nLet’s think again.\n\nIf A, B, C are distinct points on a circle, and C lies on line AB, then A, B, C are collinear and lie on the circle. But a straight line can intersect a circle in at most **two** distinct points.\n\nTherefore, **it is impossible** for three distinct points A, B, C on a circle to be collinear.\n\nThis suggests that the only way for point C to lie on line AB is if **C coincides with either A or B**.\n\nBut then triangle ABC would degenerate into a line segment — not a triangle.\n\nSo the problem must be interpreted differently.\n\n---\n\n**Re-examining the problem statement:**\n\n> “A perpendicular is drawn from point C to line L1, meeting L1 at point C (i.e., the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB coincides with point C itself, implying that point C lies on AB and the perpendicular is degenerate).”\n\nThis is a bit confusingly worded. Let’s parse it.\n\nIt says: the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB is point C.\n\nThat **only** happens if C is on AB.\n\nBut as we just saw, if C is on AB and all three are on the circle, then they must be collinear — impossible for three distinct points on a circle.\n\nTherefore, the only logical conclusion is that **the problem is describing a degenerate case**, or perhaps there is a typo.\n\nBut let’s read the **final question**:\n\n> What is the length of Line_C_C?\n\n“Line_C_C” — that is, the line from point C to point C.\n\nThat’s a point — not a line segment with positive length.\n\nThe distance from any point to itself is **zero**.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nRegardless of the geometric contradictions in the setup (which may be intentional to test attention to detail), the question asks for the length of “Line_C_C”, which is the distance from point C to itself.\n\nThat is always **0**.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n$\\boxed{0}$"
