    "We are given a geometric construction involving a **regular octagon** centered at **O1**, with side length **3**. A **square** is derived such that:\n\n- One of its **vertices is at O1**.\n- The **square’s radius** (distance from center E to any vertex) equals the **circumradius of the octagon**.\n- Point **I** lies on a **side of the square**.\n- Point **E** is the **center of the square**.\n- We are to find the length of segment **IE**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the regular octagon’s circumradius\n\nA regular octagon with side length $ s $ has a **circumradius** $ R $ given by the formula:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)}\n$$\n\nGiven $ s = 3 $, we compute:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{3}{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)}\n$$\n\nWe know that:\n\n$$\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right) = \\sin(22.5^\\circ) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos(45^\\circ)}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nWe can rationalize this later if needed, but let’s keep it for now.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Understand the square\n\nThe square has:\n\n- **Center at E**\n- **One vertex at O1**\n- **Radius (distance from E to any vertex) = R = circumradius of octagon**\n\nSo, the square is centered at E, and O1 is one of its vertices. That means the distance from E to O1 is R.\n\nIn a square, the distance from center to a vertex is $ \\frac{s_{\\text{square}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}/2 $? Wait — let’s clarify.\n\nActually, in a square of side length $ a $, the **distance from center to vertex** (i.e., the circumradius of the square) is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a \\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\quad \\text{Wait — let's do it properly.}\n$$\n\nActually, in a square, the diagonal is $ a\\sqrt{2} $, so from center to vertex is **half the diagonal**:\n\n$$\nR_{\\text{square}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} \\quad \\text{No — simpler:}\n$$\n\n$$\nR_{\\text{square}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nSo if the square’s radius is R, then:\n\n$$\n\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2} = R \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{2R}{\\sqrt{2}} = R\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSo the side length of the square is $ R\\sqrt{2} $.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Positioning the square and point I\n\nWe are told:\n\n- The square is centered at E.\n- One of its vertices is at O1.\n- Point I lies on a **side** of the square.\n\nWe are to find the distance from E to I, where I is on a side of the square.\n\nBut we are not told *which* side — so we must assume the most natural configuration.\n\nSince the square has center E and vertex O1, and I is on a side, the minimal distance from E to a side is the **apothem** of the square.\n\nWait — in a square, the distance from center to a side is called the **apothem**, and it is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Apothem} = \\frac{a}{2}\n$$\n\nBecause from center to side is half the side length (since center is equidistant to all sides).\n\nBut is point I *any* point on the side? Or is it a specific point?\n\nLooking back at the diagram description (even though we don’t have the image, we can infer from the labels):\n\nThe square has vertices: O1, I, J, K — from the labels in the diagram (O1, D, I, J, K, E, F, etc.)\n\nFrom the labels, it seems that O1 is one vertex, and I is an adjacent vertex? Wait — no, the problem says:\n\n> \"Point I lies on a side of the square\"\n\nSo I is **on a side**, not necessarily a vertex.\n\nBut in the diagram, points are labeled: O1, D, I, J, K, E, F, G, H, A, B, C.\n\nAnd we are told E is the center of the square, and O1 is a vertex of the square.\n\nAlso, from the diagram’s structure, it appears that the square is oriented such that its sides are at 45° to the octagon? Or aligned?\n\nBut since we are not given orientation, and we are to find IE, and I is on a side, the most logical interpretation is that **I is the midpoint of a side** — because that would make IE perpendicular to the side, and give the minimal distance (apothem), and it’s the most symmetric point.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I is the point where the square’s side intersects something else — but the problem doesn’t specify.\n\nWait — re-reading:\n\n> \"Point I lies on a side of the square, and point E is the center of the square. Segment IE connects these two points.\"\n\nNo other constraints. So technically, IE could be any length from 0 to R, depending on where I is on the side.\n\nBut that can’t be — the problem must imply a specific point I.\n\nLooking at the diagram labels: we have points O1, D, I, J, K, E, F, G, H, A, B, C.\n\nFrom the connections:\n\n- O1 is connected to D and C1? Wait — the diagram says O1, and also C1? Probably typo — likely O1 and C are different.\n\nActually, looking at the diagram description:\n\nPoints: I, J, K, E, F, G, H, A, B, C, D, O1\n\nConnections: I to J, I to D, I to E? Wait — from the text:\n\n“Segment IE connects these two points.”\n\nAnd from the diagram structure, it seems that E is connected to I, and I is a vertex of the square? Or on a side?\n\nWait — in the diagram, point I is connected to J and D and E? Let me try to reconstruct.\n\nActually, the diagram likely shows:\n\n- The octagon: A, B, C, D, O1, G, H, I? No — labels are A to H for octagon? But we have 12 points.\n\nWait — perhaps the octagon is A, B, C, D, O1, G, H, I? But O1 is the center? No — problem says octagon is centered at O1.\n\nWait — the problem says:\n\n> \"a regular octagon centered at O1\"\n\nSo O1 is the center, not a vertex.\n\nBut then it says:\n\n> \"a square centered at point E is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1\"\n\nSo O1 is a **vertex** of the square, and the **center** of the octagon.\n\nSo the square has vertex at O1, center at E.\n\nSo distance EO1 = R (circumradius of octagon).\n\nNow, point I is on a side of the square.\n\nBut which side? The side adjacent to O1? Or opposite?\n\nThe diagram likely shows that I is on the side adjacent to O1 — perhaps the side that is “next” to O1.\n\nBut to make progress, let’s assume that I is the **midpoint of the side adjacent to O1**.\n\nThat is, from vertex O1, moving along one side of the square to the next vertex, say P, then I is the midpoint of O1P.\n\nThen, we can compute IE.\n\nLet’s try that.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Coordinate geometry approach\n\nLet’s place the square on the coordinate plane.\n\nLet’s place point E (center of square) at the origin: $ E = (0, 0) $.\n\nSince O1 is a vertex of the square, and distance from E to O1 is R, let’s place O1 at $ (R, 0) $ — along the x-axis.\n\nSince it’s a square, the vertices are at:\n\n- $ (R, 0) $ — O1\n- $ (0, R) $\n- $ (-R, 0) $\n- $ (0, -R) $\n\nWait — no! That would be a square rotated 45°, with vertices on the axes.\n\nIn a square centered at origin, with vertices on the axes, the vertices are at $ (\\pm R, 0) $, $ (0, \\pm R) $, but then the side length is not consistent.\n\nWait — if vertices are at $ (R,0), (0,R), (-R,0), (0,-R) $, then the distance between (R,0) and (0,R) is:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{(R-0)^2 + (0-R)^2} = \\sqrt{R^2 + R^2} = R\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSo side length is $ R\\sqrt{2} $, which matches what we had earlier.\n\nAnd the distance from center to vertex is R, which is correct.\n\nSo this is a valid placement.\n\nSo vertices of the square are:\n\n- V1: $ (R, 0) $ — O1\n- V2: $ (0, R) $\n- V3: $ (-R, 0) $\n- V4: $ (0, -R) $\n\nNow, the sides are between these vertices.\n\nThe side adjacent to O1 (which is V1) is from V1 to V2: from $ (R, 0) $ to $ (0, R) $.\n\nThe midpoint of this side is:\n\n$$\nI = \\left( \\frac{R+0}{2}, \\frac{0+R}{2} \\right) = \\left( \\frac{R}{2}, \\frac{R}{2} \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, E is at $ (0, 0) $, so distance IE is:\n\n$$\nIE = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{R}{2} - 0 \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{R}{2} - 0 \\right)^2 } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{R^2}{4} + \\frac{R^2}{4} } = \\sqrt{ \\frac{R^2}{2} } = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nSo IE = $ \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}} $\n\nBut recall that R is the circumradius of the octagon:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nIE = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nSimplify the denominator:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2(2 - \\sqrt{2})} = \\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nIE = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nWe can rationalize or simplify this.\n\nLet’s simplify $ \\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}} $.\n\nAssume $ \\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} $, then squaring:\n\n$$\n(\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b})^2 = a + b - 2\\sqrt{ab} = 4 - 2\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n- $ a + b = 4 $\n- $ 2\\sqrt{ab} = 2\\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow \\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow ab = 2 $\n\nSo solve:\n\n$ a + b = 4 $, $ ab = 2 $\n\nQuadratic: $ x^2 - 4x + 2 = 0 $\n\nSolutions:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{16 - 8}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm \\sqrt{8}}{2} = \\frac{4 \\pm 2\\sqrt{2}}{2} = 2 \\pm \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} - \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} \\quad \\text{? No — wait, we have } \\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} \\text{ with } a = 2+\\sqrt{2}, b=2-\\sqrt{2}?\n\nActually, since $ a = 2+\\sqrt{2}, b=2-\\sqrt{2} $, then:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{a} - \\sqrt{b} = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}} - \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nBut squaring this:\n\n$$\n(\\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}} - \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}})^2 = (2+\\sqrt{2}) + (2-\\sqrt{2}) - 2\\sqrt{(2+\\sqrt{2})(2-\\sqrt{2})} = 4 - 2\\sqrt{4 - 2} = 4 - 2\\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nYes! So,\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}} - \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}} \\quad \\text{but this is not helpful for simplification.}\n$$\n\nAlternatively, we can rationalize the denominator.\n\nWe have:\n\n$$\nIE = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by $ \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} $:\n\nNote that:\n\n$$\n(4 - 2\\sqrt{2})(4 + 2\\sqrt{2}) = 16 - (2\\sqrt{2})^2 = 16 - 8 = 8\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nIE = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{8}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}}{2\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$\n= \\frac{3}{2\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nNow, simplify $ \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} $.\n\nSimilarly, assume $ \\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{a} + \\sqrt{b} $, then:\n\n$$\na + b + 2\\sqrt{ab} = 4 + 2\\sqrt{2}\n\\Rightarrow a + b = 4, \\sqrt{ab} = \\sqrt{2} \\Rightarrow ab = 2\n$$\n\nSame as before, so $ a = 2+\\sqrt{2}, b=2-\\sqrt{2} $, so:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{4 + 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{2+\\sqrt{2}} + \\sqrt{2-\\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nBut again, not simplifying nicely.\n\nPerhaps we can leave it in terms of R, but the problem likely expects a numerical value or simplified radical.\n\nRecall that:\n\n$$\nIE = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}}, \\quad R = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nIE = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2(2 - \\sqrt{2})}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nNow, let's compute the numerical value to check.\n\nFirst, compute $ \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142 $\n\nThen $ 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\approx 2 - 1.4142 = 0.5858 $\n\nThen $ \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} \\approx \\sqrt{0.5858} \\approx 0.7654 $\n\nThen R = 3 / 0.7654 ≈ 3.919\n\nThen IE = R / sqrt(2) ≈ 3.919 / 1.4142 ≈ 2.771\n\nBut perhaps there's a better way.\n\nWait — let's go back to the square.\n\nWe have IE = distance from center to midpoint of a side.\n\nIn a square, the distance from center to a side is the apothem, which is half the side length.\n\nSide length of square is $ a = R\\sqrt{2} $, as we had earlier.\n\nThen apothem = $ \\frac{a}{2} = \\frac{R\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}} $, same as before.\n\nBut is I the midpoint? The problem says \"point I lies on a side\", not necessarily the midpoint.\n\nHowever, in the diagram, if I is not the midpoint, we can't determine IE without more information.\n\nBut in the diagram, from the labels, it seems that I is a vertex of the square? Let's check the diagram description.\n\nThe user provided a diagram with points: I, J, K, E, F, G, H, A, B, C, D, O1.\n\nAnd connections: I is connected to J, to D, to E? From the text, \"segment IE connects these two points.\"\n\nAlso, from the octagon, O1 is center, and the square has vertex at O1.\n\nPerhaps I is not on the side, but is a vertex? But the problem says \"on a side\".\n\nAnother possibility: in the diagram, the square is not rotated 45°, but aligned with axes.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nSuppose the square is axis-aligned.\n\nLet E be at (0,0).\n\nLet O1 be at (R, 0) — a vertex.\n\nThen for a square centered at (0,0) with vertex at (R,0), the square must extend to (R,0), (0,R), (-R,0), (0,-R) — same as before. So it's rotated 45°.\n\nIf it were axis-aligned, with vertex at (R,0), then the center would not be at (0,0) unless the square is from (-a/2, -a/2) to (a/2, a/2), but then vertex at (a/2, a/2), not on axis.\n\nSo to have a vertex on the x-axis at (R,0), and center at (0,0), the square must be diamond-shaped, i.e., rotated 45°.\n\nSo our coordinate system is correct.\n\nNow, perhaps in the diagram, point I is not the midpoint, but another point.\n\nLooking at the labels: the square has vertices O1, and then I, J, K.\n\nFrom the diagram, it seems that the square is O1, I, J, K, with E center.\n\nAnd I is connected to O1 and to J, so I is a vertex? But the problem says \"point I lies on a side\", not a vertex.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nPerhaps \"on a side\" means on the boundary, including vertices, but typically \"on a side\" means on the edge, not necessarily vertex.\n\nBut if I is a vertex, then IE = R, but that seems too large, and the problem likely wants a different answer.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"radius\" of the square means something else, but we assumed it's the distance from center to vertex.\n\nPerhaps \"radius\" means distance from center to side, i.e., apothem.\n\nLet's check the problem:\n\n> \"the square’s radius equals the circumradius of the octagon\"\n\n\"Radius\" for a square is ambiguous, but in context, since it's compared to \"circumradius\" of the octagon, which is distance from center to vertex, so likely \"radius\" of the square means distance from center to vertex.\n\nSo our interpretation is correct.\n\nPerhaps point I is the foot of the perpendicular from E to the side, i.e., the apothem, which is what we calculated.\n\nAnd in many problems, when they say \"a point on a side\" without specification, and ask for distance from center, they mean the closest point, i.e., the foot of the perpendicular.\n\nSo IE = apothem = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} \n\nLet's simplify this expression.\n\nLet me write:\n\n$$\nIE = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2(2 - \\sqrt{2})}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nNow, let's rationalize or simplify.\n\nLet me square IE to see if it's nice.\n\n$$\nIE^2 = \\frac{9}{4 - 2\\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{9}{2(2 - \\sqrt{2})} = \\frac{9}{2(2 - \\sqrt{2})} \\cdot \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{9(2 + \\sqrt{2})}{2(4 - 2)} = \\frac{9(2 + \\sqrt{2})}{2 \\cdot 2} = \\frac{9(2 + \\sqrt{2})}{4}\n$$\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nIE^2 = \\frac{9(2 + \\sqrt{2})}{4}\n$$\n\nThen:\n\n$$\nIE = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{2}\n$$\n\nBecause:\n\n$$\n\\left( \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{9 (2 + \\sqrt{2})}{4} = IE^2\n$$\n\nYes!\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nIE = \\frac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nThis is a simplified radical form.\n\nWe can leave it like this, or numerical, but likely this is the expected answer.\n\nLet me verify with numerical value.\n\n\\sqrt{2} ≈ 1.4142\n\n2 + \\sqrt{2} ≈ 3.4142\n\n\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} ≈ \\sqrt{3.4142} ≈ 1.8478\n\nThen IE ≈ (3/2) * 1.8478 = 1.5 * 1.8478 = 2.7717, which matches our earlier calculation.\n\nSo this is correct.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{3}{2} \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$"
