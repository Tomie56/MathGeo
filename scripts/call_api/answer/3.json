    "Let’s analyze the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the construction\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There is a **regular triangle** (equilateral triangle) centered at **O₁**, with **side length 1**.\n- It is **rotated by π/3 radians** (60°).\n- Then, a **congruent triangle** centered at **O₂** is **translated perpendicular to its first side**.\n- After these operations, **eight total points** are formed, including intersections.\n- **Two new line segments are added by splitting**, resulting in **eight line segments total**, no arcs.\n- Points **D and B lie on existing segments**, and segment **DB is explicitly drawn**.\n- We are to find the **length of segment DB**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Visualize the construction\n\nSince we don’t have the actual image, we must reconstruct based on the description.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- The first triangle is centered at O₁, side length 1.\n- Rotated by π/3 — since it’s equilateral, rotating by 60° maps it onto itself, but perhaps the rotation is applied to the triangle’s position relative to the plane, or to generate a new triangle?\n\nWait — the problem says: “a regular triangle centered at O₁ with side length 1 is rotated by π/3 radians. Following one round of translation—where a congruent triangle centered at O₂ is translated perpendicular to its first side—eight total points are formed...”\n\nThis suggests:\n\n1. Start with equilateral triangle T₁ centered at O₁, side length 1.\n2. Rotate T₁ by π/3 to get T₂ (possibly overlapping or adjacent).\n3. Then, translate a congruent triangle (maybe T₂ or a new one) to center O₂, perpendicular to its first side — this creates a new triangle T₃.\n4. The intersections of these triangles (and possibly their sides) create 8 total points.\n5. Two new segments are added by “splitting” — perhaps meaning that existing segments are subdivided at intersection points, and two new segments are drawn (maybe diagonals or connectors), bringing total segments to 8.\n6. Points D and B lie on existing segments, and segment DB is drawn — we need its length.\n\nThis is highly abstract. Let’s try to model it.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Model the equilateral triangle\n\nLet’s place the first equilateral triangle with center O₁ at the origin (0,0), and side length 1.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the **distance from center to vertex** (circumradius) is:\n\n> R = s / √3\n\nWait — correction:\n\nActually, for an equilateral triangle of side length **s**, the **circumradius** (distance from center to vertex) is:\n\n> R = s / √3 * (√3 / 2) * 2? Let’s derive it.\n\nHeight of equilateral triangle: h = (√3 / 2) * s\n\nCentroid (which coincides with circumcenter in equilateral triangle) is located at 2/3 of the height from a vertex.\n\nSo distance from center to vertex = (2/3) * h = (2/3) * (√3 / 2) * s = (√3 / 3) * s = s / √3\n\nYes, so for s = 1, R = 1 / √3.\n\nSo let’s place triangle T₁ with center at O₁ = (0,0), and vertices at:\n\nWe can place one vertex at (R, 0) = (1/√3, 0), and the other two at 120° and 240°.\n\nSo vertices of T₁:\n\n- A: (1/√3, 0)\n- B: (1/√3 * cos(120°), 1/√3 * sin(120°)) = (1/√3 * (-1/2), 1/√3 * (√3/2)) = (-1/(2√3), 1/2)\n- C: (1/√3 * cos(240°), 1/√3 * sin(240°)) = (1/√3 * (-1/2), 1/√3 * (-√3/2)) = (-1/(2√3), -1/2)\n\nWait — but in the diagram, points are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F — and O1, O2.\n\nLooking at the diagram description:\n\n- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F — 6 points\n- O1, O2 — 2 more → total 8 points.\n\nSo the 8 points are: A, B, C, D, E, F, O1, O2.\n\nWait — but O1 and O2 are centers, not necessarily vertices. The problem says “eight total points are formed, including intersections”. So perhaps O1 and O2 are not counted as “formed” points? But it says “including intersections”, so maybe O1 and O2 are among the 8.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the 8 points are the vertices and intersection points.\n\nBut let’s look at the diagram’s structure.\n\nFrom the diagram description:\n\n- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F — 6 points\n- O1, O2 — 2 points → total 8.\n\nAnd segment DB is drawn.\n\nAlso, the construction involves:\n\n- Triangle centered at O1 → rotated → then translated to O2.\n\nPerhaps the two triangles (original and rotated) intersect, and the translation creates a third triangle? But it says “a congruent triangle centered at O2 is translated...” — so maybe only two triangles: one at O1, one at O2.\n\nLet’s assume:\n\n- Triangle 1: centered at O1, vertices A, B, C\n- Triangle 2: centered at O2, vertices D, E, F\n\nAnd they are arranged such that sides intersect, creating additional points? But the problem says “eight total points are formed, including intersections” — so perhaps the 6 vertices plus 2 intersection points? But 6+2=8.\n\nBut in the diagram, we have 6 labeled points (A-F) and 2 centers (O1, O2) — so likely the 8 points are A, B, C, D, E, F, O1, O2.\n\nAnd segment DB is drawn — from D to B.\n\nWe need to find length DB.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Assume positions based on symmetry\n\nSince the problem involves rotation by π/3 and translation perpendicular to a side, and the triangles are equilateral with side 1, we can assume a symmetric configuration.\n\nLet’s assume:\n\n- Triangle 1 (centered at O1) has vertices A, B, C.\n- After rotation by π/3, we get a new triangle — but since rotating an equilateral triangle by 60° around its center maps it to itself, perhaps the rotation is applied to generate a different triangle? Or perhaps the rotation is not around O1, but in the plane?\n\nThe problem says: “a regular triangle centered at O₁ with side length 1 is rotated by π/3 radians.” — it doesn’t specify the axis, but since it’s 2D, likely around O1.\n\nBut rotating an equilateral triangle by 60° around its center gives the same triangle — so perhaps it’s rotated to a new position? Or perhaps it’s rotated and then translated?\n\nThe next part: “Following one round of translation—where a congruent triangle centered at O₂ is translated perpendicular to its first side”\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nPerhaps the construction is:\n\n1. Start with equilateral triangle T1 centered at O1.\n2. Rotate T1 by π/3 around O1 to get T2 — but since it’s symmetric, T2 = T1.\n3. Then, translate a copy of the triangle (congruent) to center O2, such that the translation is perpendicular to one of its sides.\n\nBut then how are O1 and O2 related?\n\nPerhaps the two triangles are arranged such that they share a common side or are adjacent.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the \"rotation\" is not around the center, but the triangle is rotated in the plane and then translated.\n\nBut let’s look for a different approach.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Use the diagram's structure\n\nFrom the diagram description:\n\n- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F — 6 points\n- O1, O2 — 2 points\n- Lines: AB, BC, CA (first triangle), and CD, DE, EF, FD? But it says \"eight line segments total\".\n\nAlso, segment DB is drawn.\n\nFrom the connections:\n\n- B is connected to A and C (first triangle)\n- C is connected to B and D\n- D is connected to C and F\n- F is connected to D and E\n- E is connected to F and C? Not sure.\n\nThe diagram has:\n\n- A vertical line from A to C\n- B connected to A and C\n- C connected to B, D, and E? \n- D connected to C and F\n- E connected to C and F? \n- F connected to D and E\n\nAlso, O1 is inside triangle ABC, O2 is inside triangle CDF or CEF?\n\nPerhaps triangle ABC and triangle CDE or CDF are the two triangles.\n\nBut let’s assume that the two equilateral triangles share the side BC or CD.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the two triangles are arranged in a \"star of David\" pattern, but with side length 1.\n\nIn a Star of David, two equilateral triangles overlap, forming a hexagram, with 6 outer points and 1 center, but here we have 8 points.\n\nPerhaps the two triangles are separated, and their sides intersect.\n\nLet’s try to calculate based on the most symmetric configuration.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Assume specific coordinates\n\nLet’s place the first equilateral triangle with center O1 at (0,0), and let’s orient it with a horizontal base.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle with side length 1, centered at origin.\n\nThe coordinates of the vertices can be:\n\nLet’s use a standard placement:\n\nLet’s place vertex B at the top, A and C at the base.\n\nBut to make calculation easier, let’s place the triangle with a vertex at the top.\n\nStandard coordinates for equilateral triangle with side 1, centered at origin:\n\nThe height h = √3 / 2\n\nCentroid is at 2/3 the height from a vertex.\n\nSo if we place vertex A at (0, h/3) = (0, √3/6), then the base is at y = -√3/3, and vertices B and C at (-1/2, -√3/3) and (1/2, -√3/3)? Let's check the distance from A to B.\n\nDistance from A(0, √3/6) to B(-1/2, -√3/3):\n\ndx = -1/2, dy = -√3/3 - √3/6 = -√3/2\n\nDistance = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Good.\n\nAnd distance from B to C: from (-1/2, -√3/3) to (1/2, -√3/3) = 1. Good.\n\nSo vertices:\n\n- A: (0, √3/6)\n- B: (-1/2, -√3/3)\n- C: (1/2, -√3/3)\n\nCenter O1: centroid = average of vertices = ( (0 -1/2 +1/2)/3, (√3/6 -√3/3 -√3/3)/3 ) = (0, (√3/6 - 2√3/3)/3) = (0, (√3/6 - 4√3/6)/3) = (0, (-3√3/6)/3) = (0, -√3/6)\n\nWait, that can't be right because we placed A at (0, √3/6), B and C at y= -√3/3 = -2√3/6, so centroid y = ( √3/6 -2√3/6 -2√3/6 ) /3 = ( -3√3/6 ) /3 = -√3/6\n\nBut we wanted center at (0,0). So we need to shift the triangle up by √3/6.\n\nSo let's redefine:\n\nLet’s place the centroid at (0,0).\n\nSo vertices:\n\n- A: (0, h) where h is the distance from centroid to vertex.\n\nAs before, for side length s=1, distance from centroid to vertex is R = s / √3 = 1/√3\n\nAnd the height of the triangle is (√3/2)*s = √3/2\n\nCentroid is at 2/3 the height from vertex, so from centroid to vertex is 1/3 of the height? No:\n\nFrom vertex to centroid is 2/3 of the median, and median length is (√3/2)*s = √3/2, so distance from centroid to vertex is (2/3)*(√3/2) = √3/3 = 1/√3. Yes.\n\nSo to have centroid at (0,0), we can place:\n\n- A: (0, 1/√3)\n- B: ( -1/2, -1/(2√3) )  [since in equilateral triangle, the base vertices are at 30° below horizontal]\n- C: ( 1/2, -1/(2√3) )\n\nLet's verify distance from A to B:\n\ndx = -1/2, dy = -1/(2√3) - 1/√3 = -1/(2√3) - 2/(2√3) = -3/(2√3) = -√3/2\n\nDistance = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (√3/2)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3/4) = sqrt(1) = 1. Good.\n\nDistance from B to C: from (-1/2, -1/(2√3)) to (1/2, -1/(2√3)) = 1. Good.\n\nSo triangle 1: vertices A(0, 1/√3), B(-1/2, -1/(2√3)), C(1/2, -1/(2√3)), center O1(0,0).\n\nNow, rotate this triangle by π/3 radians (60°) around O1.\n\nRotation by 60° counterclockwise:\n\nThe rotation matrix is:\n[ cos60  -sin60 ]   [ 1/2    -√3/2 ]\n[ sin60   cos60 ] = [ √3/2    1/2  ]\n\nApply to each vertex.\n\nVertex A(0, 1/√3):\n\nx' = (1/2)(0) + (-√3/2)(1/√3) = 0 - (√3/2)(1/√3) = -1/2\n\ny' = (√3/2)(0) + (1/2)(1/√3) = 0 + 1/(2√3)\n\nSo A' = (-1/2, 1/(2√3))\n\nVertex B(-1/2, -1/(2√3)):\n\nx' = (1/2)(-1/2) + (-√3/2)(-1/(2√3)) = -1/4 + (√3/2)(1/(2√3)) = -1/4 + 1/4 = 0\n\ny' = (√3/2)(-1/2) + (1/2)(-1/(2√3)) = -√3/4 - 1/(4√3) = - (3/4√3) - 1/(4√3) = -4/(4√3) = -1/√3\n\nSo B' = (0, -1/√3)\n\nVertex C(1/2, -1/(2√3)):\n\nx' = (1/2)(1/2) + (-√3/2)(-1/(2√3)) = 1/4 + (√3/2)(1/(2√3)) = 1/4 + 1/4 = 1/2\n\ny' = (√3/2)(1/2) + (1/2)(-1/(2√3)) = √3/4 - 1/(4√3) = (3/4√3) - 1/(4√3) = 2/(4√3) = 1/(2√3)\n\nSo C' = (1/2, 1/(2√3))\n\nSo after rotation, the triangle has vertices:\n\n- A'(-1/2, 1/(2√3))\n- B'(0, -1/√3)\n- C'(1/2, 1/(2√3))\n\nBut this is just a rotation of the original triangle, so it's the same triangle, just rotated.\n\nNow, the problem says \"Following one round of translation—where a congruent triangle centered at O₂ is translated perpendicular to its first side\"\n\nSo perhaps after rotation, we translate a copy of the triangle to a new center O2, such that the translation is perpendicular to its first side.\n\nWhat is \"its first side\"? Perhaps the side that was originally horizontal or something.\n\nPerhaps the \"first side\" is side BC or AB.\n\nLet's assume that after rotation, we take the rotated triangle and translate it perpendicular to one of its sides.\n\nBut the problem says \"a congruent triangle centered at O2 is translated perpendicular to its first side\" — so perhaps the triangle at O2 is the translated one.\n\nPerhaps the construction is:\n\n- Start with triangle at O1.\n- Rotate it by 60° to get a new orientation.\n- Then, translate a copy of the triangle (congruent) to center O2, with the translation vector perpendicular to one of its sides.\n\nBut to make it concrete, let's assume that the translation is such that the new triangle is shifted in a direction perpendicular to side BC of the original triangle.\n\nIn the original triangle, side BC is from B(-1/2, -1/(2√3)) to C(1/2, -1/(2√3)), so it's horizontal.\n\nSo perpendicular to BC is vertical.\n\nSo if we translate the triangle vertically, say upward or downward.\n\nBut the problem says \"translated perpendicular to its first side\" — and \"its\" refers to the triangle at O2, but we don't know its orientation yet.\n\nPerhaps after rotation, the \"first side\" is different.\n\nThis is getting too ambiguous.\n\nLet's look at the diagram again.\n\nFrom the diagram description:\n\n- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F\n- O1, O2\n- Lines: likely the two triangles share a common vertex or side.\n\nNotice that in the diagram, C is connected to B, D, and E? And D is connected to C and F, etc.\n\nAlso, segment DB is drawn.\n\nPerhaps B and D are vertices of the two different triangles.\n\nAssume that triangle 1 is ABC, triangle 2 is CDE or CDF.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the two triangles are arranged so that they share the vertex C, and are rotated relative to each other.\n\nFor example, triangle ABC and triangle CDF, with angle at C being 60° or 120°.\n\nLet's assume that.\n\nSuppose we have triangle ABC equilateral, side 1.\n\nThen at vertex C, we attach another equilateral triangle CDF, rotated by 60° relative to ABC.\n\nSo if ABC is oriented with B at left, C at right, A at top, then CDF could be oriented with D below C, F to the right, etc.\n\nBut let's calculate.\n\nPlace point C at (0,0) for simplicity.\n\nLet’s place triangle ABC with C at (0,0), B at (-1,0), A at (-1/2, √3/2) — so side length 1.\n\nThen, at C, we attach another equilateral triangle CDF, rotated by 60°.\n\nIf we rotate the side CB by 60° around C, we get a new side.\n\nSide CB is from C(0,0) to B(-1,0), so vector <-1,0>.\n\nRotate this vector by 60° counterclockwise: <-1,0> rotated by 60° is:\n\nx' = -1 * cos60 - 0 * sin60 = -1 * 1/2 = -1/2\n\ny' = -1 * sin60 + 0 * cos60 = -1 * √3/2 = -√3/2\n\nSo new point D at C + this vector = (0,0) + (-1/2, -√3/2) = (-1/2, -√3/2)\n\nThen, to get F, we can rotate the vector from C to A or something.\n\nSince it's equilateral, from C, we have two sides: to B and to D, and the third vertex F can be found as the point such that CDF is equilateral.\n\nFrom C(0,0), B(-1,0), D(-1/2, -√3/2)\n\nThen F can be found as the point such that CD = CF = DF = 1, and angle at C is 60°.\n\nSince we have two points B and D from C, and we want the third vertex for the triangle on the other side.\n\nThe two possible positions for F are the intersection of circles center C radius 1, and center D radius 1.\n\nCircle at C(0,0): x^2 + y^2 = 1\n\nCircle at D(-1/2, -√3/2): (x +1/2)^2 + (y + √3/2)^2 = 1\n\nExpand the second: x^2 + x + 1/4 + y^2 + y√3 + 3/4 = 1\n\nBut x^2 + y^2 = 1, so substitute:\n\n1 + x + y√3 + 1 = 1? 1 + x + y√3 + 1 = 1? No:\n\nFrom above:\n\nx^2 + y^2 + x + y√3 + 1/4 + 3/4 = 1\n\nBut x^2 + y^2 = 1, so:\n\n1 + x + y√3 + 1 = 1? 1/4 + 3/4 = 1, so:\n\n1 + x + y√3 + 1 = 1? That can't be.\n\nLet's calculate:\n\n (x +1/2)^2 + (y + √3/2)^2 = x^2 + x + 1/4 + y^2 + y√3 + 3/4 = (x^2 + y^2) + x + y√3 + 1 = 1 + x + y√3 + 1 = x + y√3 + 2\n\nSet equal to 1: x + y√3 + 2 = 1 => x + y√3 = -1\n\nFrom x^2 + y^2 = 1\n\nSo we have:\n\nx + √3 y = -1\n\nx^2 + y^2 = 1\n\nFrom first, x = -1 - √3 y\n\nSubstitute:\n\n(-1 - √3 y)^2 + y^2 = 1\n\n1 + 2√3 y + 3y^2 + y^2 = 1\n\n1 + 2√3 y + 4y^2 = 1\n\n2√3 y + 4y^2 = 0\n\n2y (√3 + 2y) = 0\n\nSo y = 0 or y = -√3/2\n\nIf y = 0, x = -1 -0 = -1, which is point B.\n\nIf y = -√3/2, x = -1 - √3*(-√3/2) = -1 - (-3/2) = -1 + 3/2 = 1/2\n\nSo F is at (1/2, -√3/2)\n\nSo triangle CDF has vertices C(0,0), D(-1/2, -√3/2), F(1/2, -√3/2)\n\nBut this is the same as the original triangle but shifted.\n\nIn this case, points are:\n\nA(-1/2, √3/2), B(-1,0), C(0,0), D(-1/2, -√3/2), F(1/2, -√3/2)\n\nAnd we need point E? The diagram has E.\n\nPerhaps E is the intersection or something.\n\nIn this configuration, we have 5 points: A,B,C,D,F.\n\nBut we need 8 points.\n\nPerhaps the two triangles are not sharing a vertex, but are separate.\n\nLet's go back to the initial coordinate system with O1 at (0,0), and assume that after rotation and translation, O2 is at a certain position.\n\nPerhaps the translation is such that the new triangle is shifted by a vector perpendicular to a side.\n\nFor example, in the original triangle, side BC is from B(-1/2, -1/(2√3)) to C(1/2, -1/(2√3)), so vector <1,0>, so perpendicular is <0,1> or <0,-1>.\n\nSo if we translate the triangle by a vector perpendicular to BC, say upward by distance d.\n\nBut what distance? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nPerhaps the translation is such that the new triangle is placed so that it shares a side or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"following one round of translation\" means that after rotation, we translate the triangle by a vector equal to its height or something.\n\nBut let's think about the final configuration.\n\nWe have 8 points: A,B,C,D,E,F,O1,O2.\n\nAnd segment DB is drawn.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, B and D are vertices of the two different triangles, and DB is a line connecting them.\n\nAssume that the two triangles are identical, side length 1, and the distance between centers O1 and O2 is such that the line DB can be calculated.\n\nPerhaps the two triangles are arranged in a way that B and D are symmetric with respect to the line joining O1 and O2.\n\nLet's assume that the two triangles are separated by a distance, and DB is the distance between a vertex of one and a vertex of the other.\n\nBut without more information, it's hard.\n\nPerhaps the \"rotation by π/3\" is not around the center, but the triangle is rotated and then the center is moved.\n\nLet's try a different approach.\n\n### Step 7: Look for symmetry or standard configuration\n\nIn many such problems, the configuration is such that the two equilateral triangles are arranged to form a regular hexagon or something.\n\nFor example, if you have two equilateral triangles sharing a common center, rotated by 60°, they form a hexagram, but that has 6 points.\n\nHere we have 8 points, so perhaps there are two separate triangles with their centers, and intersection points.\n\nPerhaps when you rotate the triangle by 60° around its center, and then translate it, the sides intersect, creating intersection points.\n\nFor example, the original triangle and the rotated triangle may intersect at points, and those are the additional points.\n\nLet's calculate that.\n\nTake triangle 1: vertices A(0, 1/√3), B(-1/2, -1/(2√3)), C(1/2, -1/(2√3))\n\nAfter rotation by 60° around O1(0,0), we have vertices A'(-1/2, 1/(2√3)), B'(0, -1/√3), C'(1/2, 1/(2√3)) as calculated earlier.\n\nNow, the original triangle and the rotated triangle may intersect.\n\nFor example, side AB of original and side A'B' of rotated may intersect.\n\nBut this might be complicated.\n\nPerhaps the \"translation\" is applied to the rotated triangle.\n\nThe problem says: \"Following one round of translation—where a congruent triangle centered at O₂ is translated perpendicular to its first side\"\n\nSo perhaps after rotating, we take the rotated triangle and translate it to a new center O2, with the translation perpendicular to its first side.\n\nAssume that \"first side\" is side A'B' or something.\n\nIn the rotated triangle, side A'B' is from A'(-1/2, 1/(2√3)) to B'(0, -1/√3)\n\nVector A'B' = (0 - (-1/2), -1/√3 - 1/(2√3)) = (1/2, -3/(2√3)) = (1/2, -√3/2)\n\nSo direction vector <1/2, -√3/2> , which is at angle -60° or 300°.\n\nPerpendicular to this would be < √3/2, 1/2> or < -√3/2, -1/2> , which is at 30° or 210°.\n\nSo if we translate the triangle by a vector in that direction.\n\nBut what magnitude? The problem doesn't specify.\n\nPerhaps the translation is by a distance equal to the side length or something.\n\nThis is not working.\n\nLet's look for a different interpretation.\n\n### Step 8: Re-read the problem\n\n\" a regular triangle centered at O₁ with side length 1 is rotated by π/3 radians. Following one round of translation—where a congruent triangle centered at O₂ is translated perpendicular to its first side—eight total points are formed, including intersections. Two new line segments are added by splitting, resulting in a total of eight line segments and no arcs. In the final configuration, points D and B lie on existing segments, and segment DB is explicitly drawn.\"\n\nPerhaps \"rotated by π/3\" means that the triangle is rotated, and then a copy is translated, and the \"first side\" is the side that was first in the original triangle.\n\nPerhaps the two triangles are identical and are placed with a specific relative position.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the \"rotation\" is not of the triangle, but the triangle is fixed, and the rotation is applied to generate the second triangle's orientation.\n\nPerhaps O2 is obtained by rotating O1 or something.\n\nLet's assume that the two centers O1 and O2 are separated by a distance, and the line O1O2 is perpendicular to a side.\n\nPerhaps in the final configuration, points B and D are symmetric, and DB is a line of symmetry.\n\nPerhaps DB is the distance between two vertices that are 120° apart in a hexagon.\n\nLet's calculate the distance between two vertices of an equilateral triangle of side 1, but that's 1.\n\nOr between vertices of two different triangles.\n\nSuppose the two triangles are placed with centers O1 and O2, and the line O1O2 is perpendicular to a side, and the distance between O1 and O2 is d.\n\nThen the distance between a vertex of one and a vertex of the other can be calculated.\n\nBut we need d.\n\nPerhaps from the \"translation perpendicular to its first side\", and since the triangle is equilateral, the distance might be related to the height.\n\nThe height of the triangle is √3/2.\n\nPerhaps the translation is by the height.\n\nAssume that the second triangle is translated by a vector of length h = √3/2 perpendicular to a side.\n\nFor example, in the original triangle, side BC is horizontal, so translate upward by √3/2.\n\nSo if O1 is at (0,0), then O2 is at (0, √3/2)\n\nThen the vertices of the second triangle are the original vertices shifted by (0, √3/2)\n\nSo A2 = A + (0, √3/2) = (0, 1/√3 + √3/2) = (0, 1/√3 + 3/(2√3)) = (0, (2/2√3) + 3/(2√3)) = (0, 5/(2√3)) \n\nB2 = B + (0, √3/2) = (-1/2, -1/(2√3) + √3/2) = (-1/2, -1/(2√3) + 3/(2√3)) = (-1/2, 2/(2√3)) = (-1/2, 1/√3)\n\nC2 = C + (0, √3/2) = (1/2, -1/(2√3) + √3/2) = (1/2, 2/(2√3)) = (1/2, 1/√3)\n\nNow, points B and D: in the diagram, B is likely a vertex of the first triangle, D of the second.\n\nSo B = (-1/2, -1/(2√3)) from first triangle.\n\nD = say B2 = (-1/2, 1/√3) from second triangle.\n\nThen segment DB from B(-1/2, -1/(2√3)) to D(-1/2, 1/√3)\n\nSame x-coordinate, so distance = | y_D - y_B | = | 1/√3 - (-1/(2√3)) | = | 1/√3 + 1/(2√3) | = | 3/(2√3) | = 3/(2√3) = √3/2\n\nRationalize: 3/(2√3) * √3/√3 = 3√3/6 = √3/2\n\nSo length DB = √3/2\n\nIs this the answer?\n\nLet's check if this makes sense with the diagram.\n\nIn this configuration, we have:\n\n- First triangle: A, B, C\n- Second triangle: A2, B2, C2\n- Centers O1(0,0), O2(0, √3/2)\n- Points: A,B,C,A2,B2,C2,O1,O2 — that's 8 points.\n\nAnd segment DB: if D is B2, B is B, then DB is from B to B2, which is vertical, length √3/2.\n\nAlso, \"points D and B lie on existing segments\" — B is a vertex, D is a vertex, so they lie on the sides of their respective triangles.\n\n\"Segment DB is explicitly drawn\" — yes.\n\n\"Two new line segments are added by splitting\" — perhaps when we draw DB, it intersects with other segments, and we add segments at the intersection, but in this case, DB is vertical at x= -1/2, and it may intersect with other sides.\n\nFor example, in the first triangle, side AB from A(0,1/√3) to B(-1/2, -1/(2√3)) , and side AC from A(0,1/√3) to C(1/2, -1/(2√3)) , etc.\n\nThe line x= -1/2 may intersect side AC or something, but in this case, DB is from B to B2, and B2 is directly above B, so it may not intersect other segments if the triangles are separate.\n\nPerhaps \"splitting\" means that when we draw DB, it splits some segments, but in this case, it might not.\n\nPerhaps D is not B2, but another point.\n\nIn the diagram, D is likely a vertex of the second triangle, and B of the first.\n\nPerhaps D is C2 or A2.\n\nLet's try D = C2 = (1/2, 1/√3)\n\nThen DB from B(-1/2, -1/(2√3)) to D(1/2, 1/√3)\n\ndx = 1, dy = 1/√3 - (-1/(2√3)) = 1/√3 + 1/(2√3) = 3/(2√3) = √3/2\n\nDistance = sqrt(1^2 + (√3/2)^2) = sqrt(1 + 3/4) = sqrt(7/4) = √7/2, which is not nice.\n\nOr D = A2 = (0, 5/(2√3)) \n\nThen DB from B(-1/2, -1/(2√3)) to A2(0, 5/(2√3)) \n\ndx = 1/2, dy = 5/(2√3) - (-1/(2√3)) = 6/(2√3) = 3/√3 = √3\n\nDistance = sqrt( (1/2)^2 + (√3)^2 ) = sqrt(1/4 + 3) = sqrt(13/4) = √13/2, not nice.\n\nSo the only nice distance is when D is directly above B, distance √3/2.\n\nMoreover, in the diagram, if B and D have the same x-coordinate, and the line is vertical, it might be what is intended.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"translated perpendicular to its first side\" — in our case, we translated perpendicular to side BC (which is horizontal), by a distance of √3/2, which is the height, so it makes sense.\n\nAnd the distance DB = √3/2.\n\nPerhaps this is the answer.\n\nTo confirm, in the final configuration, with 8 points, and 8 segments, it might work.\n\nSo I think the length of segment DB is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\\]"
