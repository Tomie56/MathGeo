    "Two circles of equal radius 5 intersect such that the center of the lower circle is O₁ and the center of the upper circle is O₂. The circles intersect at two points, labeled A and B. Arc_circle_2_A refers to the arc of the upper circle (centered at O₂) that starts at point A and follows the circle’s circumference in the counterclockwise direction to the next significant point along the arc (typically the other intersection point B, unless otherwise specified).

    "We are given two circles of **equal radius 5**, intersecting such that:\n\n- The lower circle has center **O₁**\n- The upper circle has center **O₂**\n- The circles intersect at points **A** and **B**\n- We are to find the measure of **Arc_circle_2_A**, defined as the arc of the **upper circle** (centered at O₂) from point **A**, going **counterclockwise** to the next significant point — which, by context and symmetry, is point **B**\n\nSo, essentially, we are being asked to find the **measure of arc AB** on the **upper circle** (centered at O₂), going counterclockwise from A to B.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry\n\nSince both circles have **equal radius** (r = 5), and they intersect at two points A and B, the line segment joining the centers O₁O₂ is the **perpendicular bisector** of the common chord AB.\n\nThis is a standard property of two intersecting circles of equal radius: the line joining the centers is the perpendicular bisector of the common chord.\n\nAlso, the triangle O₁AO₂ is an **isosceles triangle** with O₁A = O₂A = 5 (both radii), and similarly for O₁B and O₂B.\n\nIn fact, **O₁AO₂B** forms a **rhombus**, since all sides are equal to 5:\n\n- O₁A = O₁B = 5 (radii of lower circle)\n- O₂A = O₂B = 5 (radii of upper circle)\n- So, O₁AO₂B has four sides of length 5 → it’s a rhombus.\n\nMoreover, since the configuration is symmetric, the line O₁O₂ is perpendicular to AB and bisects it.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the Central Angle ∠AO₂B\n\nWe need the **central angle** subtended by arc AB at center O₂ — that is, angle ∠AO₂B.\n\nIn triangle O₁AO₂:\n\n- O₁A = 5\n- O₂A = 5\n- O₁O₂ = distance between centers — let’s denote this as **d**\n\nBut we don’t know **d** yet.\n\nHowever, since the configuration is symmetric and we’re not given d, we must deduce it from the fact that the two circles intersect at two points — and we’re to find the arc measure.\n\nWait — perhaps we can assume that the circles are positioned such that the line joining the centers is vertical (as implied by “lower” and “upper” circles), and the points A and B are symmetrically placed left and right.\n\nIn such a symmetric configuration, the triangle O₁AO₂ is isosceles with two sides 5, and base O₁O₂ = d.\n\nBut we still need more.\n\nActually — let’s consider the **triangle O₁AO₂**.\n\nLet’s denote the angle at O₂: ∠AO₂B — that’s the central angle we need.\n\nBut to find that, we need to know the distance between O₁ and O₂.\n\nWait — perhaps we can use the fact that in such symmetric intersecting circles of equal radius, the angle ∠AO₂B can be found if we know the distance between centers.\n\nBut since no distance is given, maybe we are to assume a **standard configuration** — such as the centers are separated by a distance equal to the radius? Or perhaps the triangle O₁AO₂ is equilateral?\n\nWait — let’s think differently.\n\nIn many such problems, when two circles of equal radius intersect such that each passes through the other’s center, then the distance between centers is equal to the radius.\n\nIs that the case here?\n\nLet’s check: if O₁O₂ = 5, then triangle O₁AO₂ has sides O₁A = 5, O₂A = 5, O₁O₂ = 5 → equilateral triangle.\n\nThen angle ∠AO₂O₁ = 60°, and similarly ∠BO₂O₁ = 60°, so total angle ∠AO₂B = 120°.\n\nThat’s a very common configuration.\n\nMoreover, in that case, the arc AB on circle centered at O₂ would be 120°, since the central angle is 120°.\n\nBut is this assumption valid? The problem doesn’t say the circles pass through each other’s centers.\n\nHowever, the problem says: “Given the symmetric configuration and equal radii” — and no other distances are given.\n\nIn the absence of additional information, the **most symmetric and standard configuration** is when the distance between centers is equal to the radius — i.e., O₁O₂ = 5.\n\nThis is the case where each circle passes through the center of the other — and this produces a very symmetric lens-shaped intersection, and the central angle is 120°.\n\nMoreover, in that case, the arc AB on either circle is 120°.\n\nLet me verify this.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Assume O₁O₂ = 5 (standard symmetric case)\n\nAssume distance between centers is 5.\n\nThen in triangle O₁AO₂:\n\n- O₁A = 5\n- O₂A = 5\n- O₁O₂ = 5\n\n→ Equilateral triangle → all angles 60°.\n\nSimilarly, triangle O₁BO₂ is also equilateral.\n\nNow, points A and B are both on both circles.\n\nThe angle ∠AO₂B is the angle at O₂ between points A and B.\n\nSince O₂A and O₂B are both radii, and the angle between them is the central angle for arc AB.\n\nIn the rhombus O₁AO₂B, since triangles O₁AO₂ and O₁BO₂ are both equilateral, the angle at O₂ between A and B is:\n\nFrom O₂, the direction to A is 60° from O₂O₁, and to B is 60° on the other side — so total angle ∠AO₂B = 60° + 60° = 120°.\n\nYes.\n\nTherefore, the central angle subtended by arc AB at O₂ is **120 degrees**.\n\nSince arc measure equals the central angle (in degrees), the measure of arc AB on the upper circle is **120°**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm Direction\n\nThe problem says: “Arc_circle_2_A refers to the arc of the upper circle (centered at O₂) that starts at point A and follows the circle’s circumference in the counterclockwise direction to the next significant point along the arc (typically the other intersection point B)”\n\nSo, from A to B counterclockwise — which, in the symmetric case, is the **minor arc** AB, which is 120°, not the major arc (240°).\n\nSince 120° < 180°, it’s the minor arc, and that’s the one intended.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{120^\\circ}\n$$"
