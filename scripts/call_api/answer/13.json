    "We are given a geometric construction involving a **regular octagon** centered at **O1** with side length 3, and a **square** centered at **E**, with one of its vertices at **O1**, and its **circumradius equal to that of the octagon**.\n\nWe are to find the **radian measure of angle ∠I-O1-K**, which is the angle at O1 formed by segments O1I and O1K.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the regular octagon\n\nA **regular octagon** has 8 equal sides and 8 equal central angles.\n\n- The central angle between two adjacent vertices is:  \n  $$\n  \\theta_{\\text{oct}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n  $$\n\n- All vertices lie on a circle centered at O1 — the **circumcircle** of the octagon.\n\nLet’s label the octagon’s vertices in order around O1: say, A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H — but wait, in the diagram, we have points labeled A through K, and O1.\n\nLooking at the diagram:\n\n- The octagon is likely labeled: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H — 8 points.\n\n- Then there’s a square with vertices including O1, I, J, K — since the square is centered at E and has one vertex at O1.\n\nBut the problem says: “a square centered at point E is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1, with its circumradius equal to that of the octagon.”\n\nSo, the square has:\n\n- Center at E\n- One vertex at O1\n- Circumradius = circumradius of octagon → so all vertices of the square lie on the same circle as the octagon’s vertices.\n\nThus, **both the octagon and the square are inscribed in the same circle centered at O1**? Wait — no.\n\nWait — the square is centered at **E**, not at O1.\n\nBut it says: “its circumradius equal to that of the octagon” — meaning the distance from the center of the square (E) to its vertices is equal to the circumradius of the octagon (which is the distance from O1 to any of its vertices).\n\nSo the square is **not** centered at O1, but at E, and has the same circumradius as the octagon.\n\nBut then, one of its vertices is at O1 — so the distance from E to O1 is equal to the circumradius of the octagon.\n\nWait — that would mean that O1 lies on the circumcircle of the square? But O1 is a vertex of the square.\n\nActually, in a square, the **circumradius** is the distance from the center to any vertex.\n\nSo if the square has center E, and one vertex is O1, then the distance EO1 = circumradius of the square = circumradius of the octagon.\n\nSo, **O1 lies on the circumcircle of the square**, and is one of its vertices.\n\nBut also, O1 is the center of the octagon.\n\nSo we have two figures:\n\n- A regular octagon centered at O1, with vertices on a circle of radius R (circumradius).\n- A square centered at E, with vertices on a circle of radius R (same R), and one vertex at O1.\n\nSo, point O1 is a vertex of the square, and the center of the octagon.\n\nThis suggests that the square is rotated relative to the octagon, and E is offset from O1.\n\nBut we are to find angle ∠I-O1-K — which is the angle at O1 between points I and K.\n\nPoints I and K are vertices of the square (since the square has vertices O1, I, J, K — from the diagram).\n\nSo, the square has vertices: O1, I, J, K — in order.\n\nSince it’s a square, the angle at each vertex is 90°, but ∠I-O1-K is the angle at O1 between I and K — which are **not adjacent** vertices of the square.\n\nIn a square, from one vertex, the two adjacent vertices are at 90°, and the opposite vertex is at 180° — but here, I and K are the two vertices **adjacent** to O1? Or are they opposite?\n\nLet’s think.\n\nIn a square, if you label the vertices in order: say, O1, I, J, K — going around.\n\nThen from O1, adjacent vertices are I and K (if it's labeled cyclically: O1 → I → J → K → O1).\n\nWait — in a square, each vertex has two adjacent vertices. So if O1 is connected to I and K, then I and K are the two neighbors of O1.\n\nThen angle ∠I-O1-K is the internal angle of the square at O1, which is **90°** or **π/2 radians**.\n\nBut wait — is that correct?\n\nIn a square, the internal angle at each vertex is 90°, yes.\n\nBut here’s the catch: **the square is not necessarily aligned with the coordinate axes**, and we are to find the angle at O1 between points I and K — which, if I and K are the two adjacent vertices to O1 in the square, then yes, ∠I-O1-K = 90° = π/2.\n\nBut let’s verify with the diagram.\n\nLooking at the diagram:\n\n- Points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H — likely the octagon vertices.\n\n- Points I, J, K — and O1 — forming a square.\n\nFrom the diagram, it appears that:\n\n- O1 is connected to D and C? Wait, no — the square is O1, I, J, K.\n\nIn the diagram:\n\n- O1 is connected to D and F? Wait, no — let’s trace.\n\nActually, from the diagram:\n\n- O1 is connected to D and to F? Wait, no — looking at the connections:\n\nThe square is: O1 — I — J — K — back to O1.\n\nAnd the octagon is: A — B — C — D — E — F — G — H — back to A.\n\nAlso, O1 is connected to D and F? In the diagram, O1 is connected to D and to F? Wait, no — in the diagram, O1 is connected to D and to F? Let me see.\n\nActually, in the diagram:\n\n- O1 is connected to D and to F? Wait, no — O1 is connected to D and to F? Let me look again.\n\nWait, the diagram shows:\n\n- O1 connected to D and to F? No — actually, from the diagram:\n\n- O1 is connected to D (which is a vertex of the octagon) and to F (another vertex of the octagon)? But D and F are two vertices of the octagon.\n\nBut in a regular octagon, the angle between two vertices separated by one vertex (i.e., two steps apart) is 2 * π/4 = π/2.\n\nWait — let’s think differently.\n\nPerhaps I and K are not adjacent to O1 in the square? Maybe the square is oriented such that O1 is one vertex, and I and K are the other two vertices not adjacent? But that doesn’t make sense.\n\nLet me try to reconstruct.\n\nAssume the regular octagon is inscribed in a circle centered at O1.\n\nThe vertices are equally spaced every π/4 radians.\n\nNow, a square is inscribed in a circle of the same radius, but centered at E, and one of its vertices is at O1.\n\nSo, the square’s center is E, and O1 is a vertex of the square.\n\nIn a square, the center is equidistant to all vertices, so EO1 = R, the circumradius.\n\nAlso, the angle at the center between two adjacent vertices of the square is 2π/4 = π/2.\n\nSo, if we consider the square’s vertices, they are at angles θ, θ+π/2, θ+π, θ+3π/2 from the center E.\n\nBut O1 is one vertex, say at angle θ from E.\n\nThen the other vertices are at θ+π/2, θ+π, θ+3π/2 from E.\n\nBut we need to find the angle at O1 between I and K.\n\nAssume the square’s vertices are: O1, I, J, K, in order.\n\nThen, from O1, the two adjacent vertices are I and K (if it's labeled consecutively).\n\nIn that case, the angle ∠I-O1-K is the internal angle of the square, which is 90° = π/2 radians.\n\nBut is that the case here?\n\nPerhaps not, because the square is not necessarily oriented with O1 as a \"corner\" in the usual sense, but since it's a square, the internal angle is always 90°.\n\nHowever, there's a catch: the problem says \"the resulting figure contains 12 distinct labeled points and 16 line segments.\"\n\nThe octagon has 8 vertices: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H.\n\nThe square has 4 vertices: O1,I,J,K.\n\nBut O1 is not a vertex of the octagon — it's the center.\n\nSo total points: 8 (octagon) + 4 (square) = 12, but if O1 is shared? No, O1 is not a vertex of the octagon; it's the center.\n\nIn a regular octagon, the center is not a vertex.\n\nSo points are: A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H (8) + O1,I,J,K (4) = 12 points. Good.\n\nNow, the square has vertices O1,I,J,K.\n\nSo, in the square, O1 is a vertex, and I and K are the two adjacent vertices to O1.\n\nTherefore, the angle at O1 between I and K is the internal angle of the square, which is 90 degrees, or π/2 radians.\n\nBut is that correct? Let me confirm with geometry.\n\nIn a square, at each vertex, the two edges are perpendicular, so the angle between them is 90°.\n\nSo, if I and K are the two vertices connected to O1 in the square, then ∠I-O1-K = 90° = π/2.\n\nBut let's make sure that I and K are indeed the adjacent vertices.\n\nIn the diagram, from O1, there are lines to I and to K, and also to D and F? Wait, in the diagram, O1 is connected to D and to F, which are vertices of the octagon.\n\nBut also, O1 is connected to I and to K? Let's see the diagram description.\n\nThe diagram shows:\n\n- O1 connected to D and to F? Or to I and K?\n\nActually, looking at the diagram:\n\n- The square is O1-I-J-K-O1.\n\n- The octagon is A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-A.\n\n- Also, O1 is connected to D and to F? In the diagram, there is a line from O1 to D and from O1 to F.\n\nBut D and F are vertices of the octagon.\n\nIn a regular octagon, the angle between two vertices separated by one vertex (e.g., D and F, with E in between) is 2 * (π/4) = π/2.\n\nSo if O1 is the center, then angle ∠D-O1-F = π/2.\n\nBut in our case, we are asked for ∠I-O1-K.\n\nNow, if I and K are vertices of the square, and O1 is a vertex of the square, then the angle at O1 is 90°.\n\nBut is O1 the center of the octagon and a vertex of the square? Yes.\n\nSo, to find ∠I-O1-K, we need to know the positions of I and K relative to O1.\n\nSince the square has circumradius R, and center at E, and O1 is a vertex, then the vector from E to O1 is of length R.\n\nThe other vertices are obtained by rotating this vector by 90°, 180°, 270° around E.\n\nSo, let’s set up coordinates to make this precise.\n\n### Step 2: Set up coordinate system\n\nLet’s place O1 at the origin for simplicity? But O1 is not the center of the square; E is.\n\nThe square is centered at E, and O1 is a vertex.\n\nLet’s place the center of the square, E, at some point.\n\nSince the circumradius is R, and O1 is a vertex, let’s place E at (0,0), and O1 at (R,0).\n\nThen, the other vertices of the square are at:\n\n- I: rotated 90° from O1 around E: (0,R)\n\n- J: rotated 180°: (-R,0)\n\n- K: rotated 270°: (0,-R)\n\nBut then the square has vertices at (R,0), (0,R), (-R,0), (0,-R) — which is a square rotated 45°, with vertices on the axes.\n\nNow, the angle at O1 (R,0) between I (0,R) and K (0,-R).\n\nSo, vectors from O1 to I: (0 - R, R - 0) = (-R, R)\n\nVectors from O1 to K: (0 - R, -R - 0) = (-R, -R)\n\nNow, the angle between vectors u = (-R, R) and v = (-R, -R)\n\nThe dot product: u · v = (-R)(-R) + (R)(-R) = R² - R² = 0\n\nSo, the angle is 90°, or π/2 radians.\n\nOh! So even though I and K are not adjacent in the square if we go O1-I-J-K, in this coordinate system, from O1, I and K are not adjacent; in fact, in this labeling, O1 is connected to I and to K? Let's see.\n\nIn the square with vertices at (R,0), (0,R), (-R,0), (0,-R), the edges are between consecutive vertices: (R,0) to (0,R), (0,R) to (-R,0), (-R,0) to (0,-R), (0,-R) to (R,0).\n\nSo, from O1 (R,0), it is connected to (0,R) and to (0,-R) — which are I and K in this case.\n\nSo yes, I and K are the two adjacent vertices to O1.\n\nAnd the angle between them is 90°, as calculated.\n\nSo, ∠I-O1-K = π/2 radians.\n\nBut is this consistent with the octagon?\n\nThe octagon is centered at O1, which is at (R,0) in this coordinate system, but the octagon is centered at O1, so its center is at (R,0), while the square's center is at (0,0).\n\nThe octagon has circumradius R, so its vertices are at distance R from O1 (R,0).\n\nSo, for example, one vertex of the octagon might be at (R,0) + (R,0) = (2R,0)? No.\n\nThe octagon is centered at O1 (R,0), with circumradius R, so its vertices are at points like (R,0) + R*(cos θ, sin θ) for θ = 0, π/4, π/2, etc.\n\nBut in particular, one vertex might be at (R,0) + R*(1,0) = (2R,0), another at (R,0) + R*(cos π/4, sin π/4) = (R + R/√2, R/√2), etc.\n\nNow, the square has vertices at (R,0), (0,R), (-R,0), (0,-R).\n\nThe point (0,R) is at distance from O1 (R,0): distance = sqrt((0-R)^2 + (R-0)^2) = sqrt(R² + R²) = R√2.\n\nBut the octagon's vertices are at distance R from O1, so (0,R) is not on the octagon's circumcircle; it's at distance R√2 from O1.\n\nBut the problem says the square has circumradius equal to that of the octagon, which is R, and one vertex at O1.\n\nIn our setup, the square's circumradius is the distance from E (0,0) to O1 (R,0), which is R, good.\n\nBut the distance from O1 to I (0,R) is R√2, which is not R, so I is not on the octagon's circumcircle.\n\nThat's fine, because I is a vertex of the square, not of the octagon.\n\nThe octagon's vertices are different points.\n\nIn the diagram, we have points A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H for the octagon, and O1,I,J,K for the square.\n\nSo, no conflict.\n\nNow, back to the angle: we have shown that in the square, at vertex O1, the angle between the two adjacent vertices I and K is 90°, or π/2 radians.\n\nAnd our calculation with vectors confirmed that the angle is π/2.\n\nMoreover, in a square, it's always 90°.\n\nSo, is the answer simply π/2?\n\nBut let's double-check the problem.\n\nIt says: \"Consider the angle ∠I-O1-K formed at vertex O1 by the line segments O1I and O1K.\"\n\nAnd from the diagram and our reasoning, I and K are the two vertices adjacent to O1 in the square, so yes.\n\nBut is there a trick? The octagon is there, and perhaps the angle is affected by the octagon's orientation.\n\nBut the angle ∠I-O1-K is solely determined by the square, since I and K are vertices of the square, and O1 is a vertex of the square.\n\nThe octagon's presence doesn't affect this angle, as long as we're only considering the points I, O1, K.\n\nMoreover, the problem asks for the angle at O1 between O1I and O1K, which are sides of the square.\n\nSo, it should be π/2.\n\nBut let's see if the diagram suggests otherwise.\n\nIn the diagram, it looks like O1 is connected to D and F, which are octagon vertices, and also to I and K.\n\nBut the angle ∠I-O1-K is specifically between I and K, not involving D or F.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, I and K are not adjacent to O1 in the square? But that would be unusual.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the square is labeled such that O1, I, J, K are in order, but I and K are not both adjacent to O1.\n\nIn a square, from one vertex, there are two adjacent vertices.\n\nIf the vertices are O1, I, J, K in cyclic order, then O1 is adjacent to I and K.\n\nYes.\n\nPerhaps the angle is the external angle or something, but no, it's the angle formed by the segments, which is the internal angle.\n\nPerhaps the square is oriented differently.\n\nAnother thought: when it says \"a square centered at point E is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1\", and \"with its circumradius equal to that of the octagon\", and the octagon is centered at O1, then the distance from E to O1 is R, and the square's vertices are at distance R from E.\n\nNow, the angle at O1 between I and K.\n\nIn vector terms, as we did, it's 90°.\n\nPerhaps the problem is that I and K are not the adjacent vertices, but in the diagram, from O1, there are lines to I and to K, and also to D and F, but the angle is specified as ∠I-O1-K, so it's between I and K.\n\nAnd in the square, if O1 is a vertex, and I and K are the other two vertices that are not opposite, but in a square, from one vertex, the two adjacent are at 90°, and the opposite is at 180°.\n\nIf I and K were opposite, the angle would be 180°, but that doesn't make sense for an angle at a vertex.\n\nIn the diagram, it's likely that I and K are the two neighbors.\n\nMoreover, in our coordinate system, we got dot product zero, so 90°.\n\nPerhaps the answer is π/2.\n\nBut let's see if there's a different interpretation.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"the resulting figure\" and the angle is not just of the square, but considering the positions relative to the octagon.\n\nFor example, perhaps I and K are also vertices of the octagon or something, but the problem says 12 distinct points: 8 for octagon, 4 for square, and O1 is not a vertex of octagon, so I,J,K are not octagon vertices.\n\nIn the diagram, points I,J,K are not labeled as octagon vertices; the octagon is A to H.\n\nSo, I,J,K are square vertices.\n\nPerhaps the angle ∠I-O1-K is the angle at O1 in the triangle I-O1-K, but since I,O1,K are three vertices of a square, and O1 is a corner, then triangle I-O1-K is a right-angled isosceles triangle, with right angle at O1.\n\nSo angle at O1 is 90°.\n\nYes.\n\nSo, I think it's straightforward.\n\nBut why is the octagon mentioned? Perhaps to distract, or perhaps to provide context for the positions.\n\nMaybe the square is inscribed in the same circle as the octagon, but centered at E, not at O1.\n\nIn that case, the circle has center E, radius R, and O1 is on it.\n\nThe octagon is centered at O1, with circumradius R, so its vertices are on a circle of radius R centered at O1.\n\nSo, the two circles are different: one centered at O1, one at E, both radius R, and they intersect at O1 and possibly other points.\n\nThe distance between centers O1 and E is R, since EO1 = R.\n\nSo, two circles of radius R, centers distance R apart.\n\nThey intersect at points that form an equilateral triangle.\n\nThe intersection points: the line joining O1 and E, and the intersection points are at 60° from that line.\n\nBut in this case, the square's vertices are on the circle centered at E, and the octagon's vertices on the circle centered at O1.\n\nNow, points I and K are on the circle centered at E, and we need the angle at O1 between I and K.\n\nSo, perhaps we need to find the angle subtended at O1 by points I and K, which are on the other circle.\n\nThat might be it.\n\nIn other words, ∠I-O1-K is the angle at O1 between points I and K, which are two points on the circle centered at E, and O1 is also on that circle.\n\nSo, we have three points: I, O1, K, all on the circle centered at E with radius R.\n\nAnd since it's a square, the arc between I and K via O1 is 90°, because in the square, from I to O1 to K is 90° at the center E.\n\nThe central angle for arc I to K passing through O1 is the angle at E between I and K.\n\nIn the square, from I to O1 to K, the angle at E is the angle between vectors E to I and E to K.\n\nIn our coordinate system, E at (0,0), O1 at (R,0), I at (0,R), K at (0,-R).\n\nThen vector E to I: (0,R), E to K: (0,-R), so angle between them is 180°, since they are opposite.\n\nBut in the square, the vertices are at 90° intervals, so from I to O1 is 90°, O1 to K is 90°, so from I to K via O1 is 180°.\n\nThe minor arc from I to K is 180°, since they are diametrically opposite.\n\nIn a square, opposite vertices are 180° apart at the center.\n\nSo, points I and K are diametrically opposite on the circle centered at E.\n\nSo, the arc IK is 180°.\n\nNow, we need the angle subtended at O1, which is also on the circle, by the chord IK.\n\nIn circle geometry, the angle subtended by an arc at the circumference is half the angle at the center.\n\nHere, the arc IK is 180°, so the angle at any point on the remaining circumference is half of that, which is 90°.\n\nYes! So, for any point on the circle, the angle subtended by a diameter is 90°.\n\nSince IK is a diameter of the circle centered at E (because I and K are opposite vertices of the square, so distance from I to K is 2R, and E is midpoint, so IK is diameter).\n\nAnd O1 is on the circle, so angle ∠I-O1-K is the angle subtended by the diameter IK at point O1 on the circumference, which is always 90°.\n\nSo, regardless of where O1 is on the circle (as long as it's not I or K), the angle is 90°.\n\nSo, in this case, ∠I-O1-K = 90° = π/2 radians.\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\nSo, the answer is π/2.\n\nBut let's make sure that in the square, I and K are indeed opposite vertices.\n\nIn our coordinate system, with E at (0,0), O1 at (R,0), I at (0,R), K at (0,-R), then I and K are at (0,R) and (0,-R), so yes, they are opposite if the square is diamond-shaped.\n\nThe vertices are at (R,0), (0,R), (-R,0), (0,-R), so yes, (0,R) and (0,-R) are opposite, and (R,0) and (-R,0) are opposite.\n\nSo, from O1 (R,0), the adjacent vertices are (0,R) and (0,-R), which are I and K.\n\nBut (0,R) and (0,-R) are not adjacent to each other; they are opposite.\n\nIn the square, O1 is connected to I and to K, and I and K are not directly connected; they are opposite.\n\nBut in the angle ∠I-O1-K, it's the angle at O1 between the two lines to I and to K, which are the two adjacent vertices, and the angle is 90°.\n\nIn the circle, since IK is diameter, and O1 on circumference, angle is 90°.\n\nSo, all consistent.\n\nTherefore, the radian measure is π/2.\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}}.\n\nBut the problem says \"expressed as a multiple of π\", and π/2 is 0.5π, so it's fine.\n\nI think that's it.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}}\\]"
