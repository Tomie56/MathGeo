    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric regular hexagons centered at O1. The outer hexagon has side length 5, and the inner one is scaled by 1/2. However, the question is about **angle ∠BAF** on the **outer hexagon**, so the inner hexagon and the rotation by π/6 are **irrelevant** to the angle we are computing — unless they affect the labeling or orientation.\n\nLet’s carefully parse the problem.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular hexagon\n\nIn a **regular hexagon**, all internal angles are 120°, and the central angle between adjacent vertices is 60° (since 360°/6 = 60°).\n\nVertices are labeled in order, say clockwise: A, F, E, D, C, B, and back to A — or possibly counterclockwise. The problem says:\n\n> Point A lies on the outer hexagon, and point F is the adjacent vertex **clockwise** from A on the outer hexagon. Point B is the next vertex **counterclockwise** from A on the outer hexagon.\n\nSo, if we go **clockwise** from A, we hit F. If we go **counterclockwise** from A, we hit B.\n\nTherefore, the order of vertices around the hexagon, going **clockwise**, is:\n\n> B → A → F → E → D → C → B\n\nWait — that can’t be, because if F is clockwise from A, and B is counterclockwise from A, then the order **clockwise** should be:\n\n> ... → B → A → F → ...\n\nBut in a hexagon, moving clockwise from A, the next vertex is F, then E, then D, then C, then B, then back to A.\n\nSo the full clockwise order is:\n\n> A → F → E → D → C → B → A\n\nThat makes sense.\n\nSo:\n\n- From A, clockwise: next is F\n- From A, counterclockwise: next is B\n\nTherefore, the six vertices in **clockwise** order: A, F, E, D, C, B.\n\nSo the angle ∠BAF is the angle at vertex A between points B, A, F.\n\nThat is, the angle between vectors AB and AF — but since B is counterclockwise from A, and F is clockwise from A, then ∠BAF is the **internal angle** of the hexagon at vertex A.\n\nWait — in a regular hexagon, the internal angle at each vertex is **120 degrees**, or **2π/3 radians**.\n\nBut let’s verify this carefully.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm angle ∠BAF is the internal angle\n\nPoints:\n\n- B is the vertex immediately counterclockwise from A.\n- F is the vertex immediately clockwise from A.\n\nSo, the angle ∠BAF is formed by segments AB and AF — that is, the two edges meeting at vertex A.\n\nIn a regular polygon, the internal angle at each vertex is:\n\n> θ = (n - 2) * π / n\n\nFor a hexagon, n = 6:\n\n> θ = (6 - 2) * π / 6 = 4π/6 = 2π/3\n\nSo ∠BAF = 2π/3 radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider the rotation and inner hexagon\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n> a regular hexagon centered at O1 with side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it...\n\nBut the angle ∠BAF is defined purely on the **outer hexagon**, using its own vertices A, B, F. The rotation by π/6 may change the *orientation* of the hexagon, but **not the internal angles** — rotation preserves angles.\n\nSimilarly, the inner hexagon is irrelevant to the angle at A on the outer hexagon.\n\nSo, **rotation and scaling do not affect the internal angle** of the regular hexagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the radian measure of angle ∠BAF is:\n\n> **2π/3**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{2\\pi}{3}}$"
