    "We are given a triangle ABC inscribed in a circle centered at O1 with radius 5. Points A, B, and C lie on the circumference. We are to find the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle at vertex A — expressed as a multiple of π.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understand the diagram**\n\nFrom the diagram description (and the image, though we can’t see it directly, we can infer from the labels):\n\n- Triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle.\n- O1 is the center of the circle.\n- Points A, B, C are on the circle.\n- The triangle appears to have points arranged such that AB and AC are chords from A, and BC is another chord.\n\nBut crucially, we are not given any explicit angle measures or arc measures. However, we are told to use **vector geometry or properties of inscribed angles**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Use the inscribed angle theorem**\n\nThe **Inscribed Angle Theorem** states:\n\n> The measure of an inscribed angle is half the measure of the central angle that subtends the same arc.\n\nSo, ∠BAC (which is an inscribed angle) subtends arc BC. Therefore:\n\n> ∠BAC = (1/2) × (measure of arc BC in radians)\n\nSo if we can find the measure of arc BC, we can find ∠BAC.\n\nBut we don’t have arc BC directly.\n\nWait — perhaps we can deduce something from the diagram’s symmetry or from the positions of the points.\n\nLooking at the diagram description again:\n\n- The triangle ABC is inscribed.\n- O1 is the center.\n- From the positions: B is at the top, C at the bottom, A on the right — forming a triangle that looks symmetric with respect to the vertical diameter BC.\n\nIn fact, if B and C are endpoints of a diameter, then ∠BAC would be a right angle (90° or π/2 radians) by **Thales’ Theorem**.\n\nLet’s check: Is BC a diameter?\n\nIf O1 is the center, and B and C are on opposite ends of a vertical line passing through O1, then yes — BC is a diameter.\n\nIn the diagram, B is at the top, C at the bottom, and O1 is in the center — so BC passes through O1 → BC is a diameter.\n\n✅ So, BC is a diameter of the circle.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Apply Thales’ Theorem**\n\n**Thales’ Theorem**: If A, B, and C are points on a circle where BC is a diameter, then ∠BAC is a right angle.\n\nTherefore, ∠BAC = 90° = π/2 radians.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Confirm using vector geometry (optional verification)**\n\nLet’s assign coordinates to verify.\n\nAssume the circle is centered at origin O1 = (0,0), radius 5.\n\nLet’s place:\n\n- Point B at (0, 5) — top of circle\n- Point C at (0, -5) — bottom of circle → so BC is vertical diameter\n- Point A is on the circle — say at (5, 0) — rightmost point (this is consistent with diagram description)\n\nNow, vectors:\n\n- Vector AB = B - A = (0 - 5, 5 - 0) = (-5, 5)\n- Vector AC = C - A = (0 - 5, -5 - 0) = (-5, -5)\n\nNow, angle at A between vectors AB and AC.\n\nActually, we need vectors **from A to B** and **from A to C**:\n\n- Vector AB = B - A = (-5, 5)\n- Vector AC = C - A = (-5, -5)\n\nThe angle θ between vectors AB and AC is given by:\n\ncosθ = (AB · AC) / (|AB| |AC|)\n\nCompute dot product:\n\nAB · AC = (-5)(-5) + (5)(-5) = 25 - 25 = 0\n\nSo cosθ = 0 → θ = π/2 radians.\n\n✅ Confirmed.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\nThe radian measure of ∠BAC is **π/2**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n$$"
