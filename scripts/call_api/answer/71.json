  "answer": [
    "We are given a circle with center O₁ and radius 5. Inside this circle is inscribed an **equilateral triangle ABC**. From vertex A, a perpendicular is drawn to side BC, meeting it at point F₀. We are to find the length of segment AF₀.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nSince triangle ABC is **equilateral and inscribed in a circle**, the circle is the **circumcircle** of the triangle. The center of the circle, O₁, is also the **centroid**, **circumcenter**, **incenter**, and **orthocenter** of the equilateral triangle (all coincide in an equilateral triangle).\n\nThe segment AF₀ is the **altitude** from vertex A to side BC. In an equilateral triangle, the altitude, median, and angle bisector from any vertex coincide.\n\nSo, AF₀ is the **altitude** of the equilateral triangle ABC.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Relate the circumradius to the side length\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the **circumradius R** is related to the side length **s** by the formula:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nWait — let’s double-check that.\n\nActually, the correct formula for the circumradius \\( R \\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} \\quad \\text{No, let's derive it properly.}\n\\]\n\nBetter approach: In an equilateral triangle, the centroid (which is also the circumcenter) divides the altitude in the ratio 2:1.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- Let the side length be \\( s \\).\n- The altitude \\( h \\) of an equilateral triangle is:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s\n\\]\n\nThe centroid (which is O₁) lies at 2/3 of the altitude from the vertex.\n\nSo, the distance from vertex A to the centroid O₁ is \\( \\frac{2}{3} h = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} s \\)\n\nBut this distance is also the **circumradius R**.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} s\n\\]\n\nSolving for \\( s \\):\n\n\\[\ns = R \\cdot \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{3}} = R \\cdot \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nGiven that \\( R = 5 \\), we have:\n\n\\[\ns = 5\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute the altitude AF₀\n\nThe altitude \\( h \\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\( s \\) is:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\( s = 5\\sqrt{3} \\):\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 5\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{5 \\cdot (\\sqrt{3})^2}{2} = \\frac{5 \\cdot 3}{2} = \\frac{15}{2} = 7.5\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm that AF₀ is indeed the altitude\n\nYes — from vertex A, perpendicular to BC, meeting at F₀. In an equilateral triangle, this perpendicular is the altitude, and since the triangle is inscribed in the circle, and O₁ is the center, the altitude passes through O₁.\n\nIn fact, in the diagram, we see that O₁ lies on AF₀, which confirms that AF₀ is the altitude and passes through the center.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7.5}\n\\]"
