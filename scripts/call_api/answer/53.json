    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the original circle (radius 5), with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle (radius 10). Points D, E, and F are additional points of tangency or intersection: D lies on arc AB, E is the midpoint of chord BC, and F lies on arc AC. In the final construction, segment FE is drawn, connecting point F to the midpoint E of BC.\n\nGiven this configuration, find the radian measure of angle BAC — that is, the angle at vertex A formed by segments AB and AC — expressed as a multiple of π."

    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric circles and a triangle ABC circumscribed about the smaller circle (radius 5), with its vertices lying on the larger circle (radius 10). We are to find the radian measure of angle BAC, expressed as a multiple of π.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\n- **Circle O1**: Center O1, radius 5.\n- **Larger circle**: Same center O1, radius 10 (scaled by factor 2).\n- **Triangle ABC**: Circumscribed about the smaller circle → meaning the smaller circle is the **incircle** of triangle ABC.\n- Vertices A, B, C lie on the larger circle → so triangle ABC is **inscribed** in the larger circle (radius 10).\n- Therefore, triangle ABC has:\n  - **Incircle** of radius 5 (centered at O1),\n  - **Circumcircle** of radius 10 (also centered at O1).\n\nThis is a **very special** configuration: the **incenter and circumcenter coincide** at O1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Key geometric insight\n\nIn a triangle, if the **incenter and circumcenter coincide**, then the triangle must be **equilateral**.\n\n> **Proof sketch**: The incenter is the intersection of angle bisectors; the circumcenter is the intersection of perpendicular bisectors. In a non-equilateral triangle, these are different points. Only in an equilateral triangle do all centers (centroid, circumcenter, incenter, orthocenter) coincide.\n\nTherefore, **triangle ABC is equilateral**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute angle BAC\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, **all angles are equal to 60 degrees**, or **π/3 radians**.\n\nThus,\n\n> **Angle BAC = π/3 radians**\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify consistency with given points D, E, F\n\nThe problem mentions points D, E, F:\n\n- D lies on arc AB → probably the point of tangency of incircle with side AB? But since the incircle is tangent to the sides, and the triangle is equilateral, the points of tangency are symmetric.\n- E is the midpoint of chord BC → in an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, the midpoint of a side is also the foot of the perpendicular from the opposite vertex, and lies on the angle bisector (which passes through the center).\n- F lies on arc AC → again, likely a point of tangency or symmetric point.\n\nBut since we’ve deduced the triangle is equilateral from the coincidence of incenter and circumcenter, and the radii are in ratio 2:1 (which is consistent with equilateral triangle geometry — see below), these points are consistent with symmetry and do not contradict our conclusion.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Optional — Confirm radius ratio for equilateral triangle\n\nIn an equilateral triangle:\n\n- Let side length = s.\n- Circumradius R = s / √3\n- Inradius r = s / (2√3)\n\nWait — let’s recall correct formulas:\n\nActually:\n\n- For equilateral triangle with side length s:\n  - **Circumradius** R = s / √3 → **No!**\n  - Correct formula: R = s / (√3) * (2/3)? Let’s derive.\n\nActually, standard formulas:\n\n- Height h = (√3 / 2) s\n- Centroid (which is also circumcenter and incenter) divides height in 2:1 ratio.\n- So, **Circumradius R = (2/3) * h = (2/3)(√3 / 2)s = s / √3**\n- **Inradius r = (1/3) * h = (1/3)(√3 / 2)s = s / (2√3)**\n\nSo, **R / r = (s / √3) / (s / (2√3)) = 2**\n\nExactly the ratio given in the problem: circumradius = 10, inradius = 5 → ratio = 2.\n\n✅ Confirmed: The triangle must be equilateral.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
