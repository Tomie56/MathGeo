    "We are given a geometry problem involving two circles, Circle O1 and Circle O2.\n\nLet’s break down the information step by step:\n\n---\n\n**Given:**\n\n- Circle O1 has center O1 and radius 5.\n- Circle O2 is obtained by translating Circle O1 vertically downward.\n- Both circles have radius 5.\n- The circles are externally tangent at point A.\n- We are to find the **circumference of Circle O1**.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Understand what is being asked**\n\nWe are being asked to find the **circumference of Circle O1**.\n\nCircumference of a circle is given by the formula:\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi r\n\\]\n\nwhere \\( r \\) is the radius of the circle.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Plug in the known value**\n\nWe are told that the radius of Circle O1 is 5.\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi \\cdot 5 = 10\\pi\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Consider if other information is relevant**\n\nThe problem mentions Circle O2, the translation, and the point of tangency A. However, the question is **only** asking for the circumference of Circle O1.\n\nSince the radius of Circle O1 is given directly as 5, and circumference depends **only** on the radius, the other information (about O2, translation, tangency) is **irrelevant** to this particular question.\n\nIt may be a distractor or part of a larger problem, but for this specific question, we do not need it.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10\\pi}\n\\]"
