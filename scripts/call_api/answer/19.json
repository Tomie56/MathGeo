    "We are given a regular octagon centered at point **O1**, with side length 3, oriented at 0 radians (meaning one vertex lies along the positive x-axis). A square is constructed with its **center at point E**, which is a **vertex of the octagon**, and the **circumradius of the square equals that of the octagon**. Points **I** and **K** are vertices of the square such that **I–E–K** is a diagonal of the square (so E is the midpoint of diagonal IK). We are to find the angle **∠I–O1–K**, i.e., the angle at O1 between points I and K.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- Regular octagon centered at O1, side length = 3.\n- Let’s place O1 at the origin (0,0) for simplicity.\n- Since the octagon is oriented at 0 radians, we can assume one vertex lies on the positive x-axis. Let’s call that vertex **A**.\n- The octagon has 8 vertices, equally spaced on a circle (the circumcircle). So the angular separation between adjacent vertices is **2π/8 = π/4 radians**.\n\nSo the vertices of the octagon are at angles:\n\n> θ_k = 0, π/4, π/2, 3π/4, π, 5π/4, 3π/2, 7π/4\n\nLet’s label the vertices in order, starting from A at angle 0:\n\n- A: 0\n- B: π/4\n- C: π/2\n- D: 3π/4\n- E: π\n- F: 5π/4\n- G: 3π/2\n- H: 7π/4\n\nSo point **E** is at angle **π** — directly to the left on the x-axis.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the circumradius of the octagon\n\nIn a regular octagon with side length **s**, the circumradius **R** is given by:\n\n> R = s / (2 sin(π/8))\n\nSince s = 3,\n\n> R = 3 / (2 sin(π/8))\n\nWe’ll keep this symbolic for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Construct the square centered at E\n\nThe square is centered at **E**, and its **circumradius equals that of the octagon**, i.e., **R**.\n\nIn a square, the circumradius (distance from center to a vertex) is **half the diagonal**.\n\nIf side length of square is **a**, then diagonal = a√2, so circumradius = (a√2)/2 = a/√2.\n\nSo:\n\n> a/√2 = R → a = R√2\n\nBut we don’t need the side length — we need to find the positions of vertices I and K of the square, such that **E is the center**, and **I and K are endpoints of a diagonal**.\n\nIn a square, the diagonals are perpendicular and of equal length, intersecting at the center.\n\nSo, if we place the square centered at E, and we want to find two opposite vertices I and K such that E is midpoint of IK, then vector from E to I and from E to K are equal in magnitude (R), opposite in direction.\n\nBut we need to know the **orientation** of the square.\n\nThe problem does **not** specify the orientation of the square, but since it says “a square is constructed such that its center is at point E — a vertex of the octagon — and its circumradius equals that of the octagon”, and then refers to points I and K as endpoints of a diagonal through E, it implies that the square is placed in the plane, and we need to find the angle ∠I–O1–K.\n\nHowever, **the orientation of the square matters**. Since no orientation is specified, we must assume the most natural one — perhaps aligned with the coordinate axes? Or perhaps aligned with the octagon?\n\nWait — the octagon is oriented at 0 radians, so its vertices lie at angles kπ/4. Point E is at angle π (on the negative x-axis).\n\nNow, the square is centered at E, and has circumradius R. The problem doesn’t specify how the square is rotated. But since it’s asking for a specific angle ∠I–O1–K, and the answer is to be a multiple of π, it suggests the angle is fixed regardless of square orientation? That can’t be — unless the square is oriented in a specific way.\n\nWait — perhaps the square is oriented such that its sides are aligned with the octagon’s symmetry? Or perhaps the diagonal IK is aligned with the line from O1 to E?\n\nLet’s think.\n\nPoint E is at angle π from O1. So vector O1E is along the negative x-axis.\n\nThe square is centered at E. The diagonal IK passes through E. So the line IK passes through E.\n\nNow, the problem says “I and K are endpoints of a diagonal passing through E” — which is redundant since in a square, diagonals pass through the center.\n\nBut the key is: **what is the direction of the diagonal IK?**\n\nSince no orientation is specified, perhaps we are to assume that the square is oriented so that its sides are aligned with the coordinate axes? Or perhaps rotated 45 degrees?\n\nWait — in a square, if you fix the center and the circumradius, the square can be rotated arbitrarily. But the angle ∠I–O1–K will depend on the orientation.\n\nBut the problem asks for a specific answer — a multiple of π — so it must be that the orientation is implied.\n\nLooking back at the diagram description: the square is constructed such that its center is at E, and circumradius equals that of the octagon. Then I and K are endpoints of a diagonal through E.\n\nBut perhaps in the diagram (which we can’t see), the square is oriented so that its sides are parallel to the sides of the octagon? Or perhaps aligned with the radial direction?\n\nWait — here’s a key insight:\n\nIn a regular octagon, the angle between adjacent vertices from the center is π/4. Point E is at angle π. The square centered at E with circumradius R — if we assume that the diagonal IK is aligned along the radial direction (i.e., along the line O1E), then I and K lie on the line through O1 and E.\n\nThat is, if IK is along the line O1E, then I and K are on the line extending from O1 through E.\n\nSince E is at distance R from O1 (because it’s a vertex of the octagon), and the square has circumradius R, then from E, we go distance R in each direction along the line O1E to get I and K.\n\nSo:\n\n- Point E is at distance R from O1, along angle π (negative x-axis).\n- So coordinates: E = (-R, 0)\n- Then I and K are located at E ± R * (direction of O1E)\n\nDirection of O1E is from O1 to E: vector (-R, 0), so unit vector is (-1, 0)\n\nSo:\n\n- I = E + R * (-1, 0) = (-R, 0) + (-R, 0) = (-2R, 0)\n- K = E - R * (-1, 0) = (-R, 0) - (-R, 0) = (0, 0) — which is O1!\n\nWait, that can’t be — K would be at O1, but O1 is the center of the octagon, not a vertex of the square.\n\nThat doesn’t make sense. If we go from E in the direction away from O1, we get I = (-2R, 0), and in the direction toward O1, we get K = (0,0) = O1. But O1 is not a vertex of the square — the square is centered at E, so its vertices are at distance R from E.\n\nSo if we go from E in the direction of the vector from O1 to E, which is (-R, 0), unit vector (-1,0), then:\n\n- I = E + R * (-1, 0) = (-R, 0) + (-R, 0) = (-2R, 0)\n- K = E + R * (1, 0) = (-R, 0) + (R, 0) = (0, 0) — again O1.\n\nBut O1 is not a vertex of the square — the square's vertices are at distance R from E, so K at (0,0) is at distance R from E? Distance from E=(-R,0) to (0,0) is R — yes, so it is on the circle. But is (0,0) a vertex of the square? Only if the square is oriented with diagonal along the x-axis.\n\nBut then K is at O1, and I is at (-2R, 0). Then angle ∠I–O1–K is the angle at O1 between points I and K. But K is O1 itself — that doesn’t make sense. You can't have an angle at a point with one of the points being the vertex itself.\n\nSo this orientation is invalid — we cannot have K at O1.\n\nTherefore, the diagonal IK is **not** along the line O1E.\n\nThen what orientation is it?\n\nPerhaps the square is oriented so that its sides are parallel to the sides of the octagon? Or perhaps rotated 45 degrees relative to the radial direction?\n\nAnother idea: in a regular octagon, the vertices are at angles kπ/4. The square centered at E (at angle π) with circumradius R — if we assume that the square is oriented with its sides parallel to the coordinate axes, then its vertices would be at:\n\nFrom center E = (-R, 0), the vertices of the square would be at:\n\n- E + (R/√2, R/√2) — but wait, no.\n\nIn a square with circumradius R (distance from center to vertex), the coordinates of vertices, if aligned with axes, are:\n\n- (R, R), (R, -R), (-R, R), (-R, -R) — but that's if center is at (0,0). The distance from center to vertex is √(R² + R²) = R√2, so to have circumradius R, we need to scale by 1/√2.\n\nSo if center is at (0,0), vertices are at:\n\n> (R/√2, R/√2), (R/√2, -R/√2), (-R/√2, R/√2), (-R/√2, -R/√2)\n\nSo for center at E = (-R, 0), the vertices are:\n\n- (-R + R/√2, 0 + R/√2) = (-R(1 - 1/√2), R/√2)\n- (-R + R/√2, 0 - R/√2) = (-R(1 - 1/√2), -R/√2)\n- (-R - R/√2, 0 + R/√2) = (-R(1 + 1/√2), R/√2)\n- (-R - R/√2, 0 - R/√2) = (-R(1 + 1/√2), -R/√2)\n\nNow, the diagonals of the square are between opposite vertices. For example, between (-R(1 - 1/√2), R/√2) and (-R(1 + 1/√2), -R/√2), and between (-R(1 - 1/√2), -R/√2) and (-R(1 + 1/√2), R/√2).\n\nThe problem says I and K are endpoints of a diagonal passing through E. So we can choose any diagonal. Let's choose the one from (-R(1 - 1/√2), R/√2) to (-R(1 + 1/√2), -R/√2).\n\nBut this is messy. Perhaps there's a better way.\n\nLet’s think geometrically.\n\nWe have:\n\n- O1 at (0,0)\n- E at (-R, 0)  [since at angle π]\n- Square centered at E, circumradius R, so vertices at distance R from E.\n- I and K are opposite vertices of the square, so vector from I to K is 2R in some direction, and E is midpoint.\n\nSo, let’s denote the vector from E to I as **v**, then from E to K is **-v**, and |v| = R.\n\nThen, the position vectors are:\n\n- I = E + v\n- K = E - v\n\nThen, the angle ∠I–O1–K is the angle at O1 between vectors O1I and O1K.\n\nSo, vectors:\n\n- O1I = I - O1 = E + v\n- O1K = K - O1 = E - v\n\nThe angle θ between vectors u and w is given by:\n\n> cosθ = (u · w) / (|u| |w|)\n\nSo let’s compute u = E + v, w = E - v\n\nThen u · w = (E + v) · (E - v) = E·E - E·v + v·E - v·v = |E|² - |v|²  (since E·v = v·E, and they cancel with opposite signs? Wait:\n\n(E + v) · (E - v) = E·E - E·v + v·E - v·v = |E|² - |v|², because E·v = v·E, so -E·v + v·E = 0.\n\nYes, so u · w = |E|² - |v|²\n\nNow, |E| = distance from O1 to E = R (since E is a vertex of the octagon)\n\n| v | = R (since v is from E to I, and I is a vertex of the square, so |v| = circumradius of square = R)\n\nSo u · w = R² - R² = 0\n\nTherefore, cosθ = 0 / (|u| |w|) = 0\n\nSo θ = π/2 radians!\n\nIs that possible? The angle is 90 degrees, regardless of the direction of v?\n\nYes! Because u · w = |E|² - |v|² = R² - R² = 0, so the vectors O1I and O1K are perpendicular.\n\nTherefore, angle ∠I–O1–K is **π/2 radians**.\n\nBut is this always true? Let me verify.\n\nWe have:\n\n- O1I = E + v\n- O1K = E - v\n- E is a vector from O1 to E, with |E| = R\n- v is a vector from E to I, with |v| = R\n- Then O1I · O1K = (E + v) · (E - v) = |E|² - |v|² = R² - R² = 0\n\nYes, always perpendicular, as long as |E| = |v| = R.\n\nAnd in this problem, |E| = R (since E is a vertex of the octagon), and |v| = R (since the square has circumradius R).\n\nSo regardless of the orientation of the square (i.e., regardless of the direction of v), the angle at O1 between I and K is always π/2.\n\nThat's a beautiful result!\n\nSo the answer is π/2.\n\nBut let me double-check with a specific example.\n\nSuppose we take v perpendicular to E.\n\nE is along the negative x-axis: E = (-R, 0)\n\nLet v be along the y-axis: v = (0, R)\n\nThen I = E + v = (-R, R)\n\nK = E - v = (-R, -R)\n\nThen O1I = (-R, R), O1K = (-R, -R)\n\nDot product: (-R)(-R) + (R)(-R) = R² - R² = 0 — perpendicular.\n\nAnother example: let v be along the x-axis: v = (R, 0) — but then I = (-R,0) + (R,0) = (0,0) = O1, which is degenerate, as before. But in this case, |v| = R, but I is at O1, which is not allowed? But mathematically, the dot product would be:\n\nO1I = (0,0) - (0,0) = (0,0)? No, if I is at (0,0), then vector O1I is from O1 to I, which is (0,0), which is undefined for angle.\n\nBut in this case, when v is parallel to E, we get I or K at O1, which is not a valid vertex for the angle, but in the problem, it says \"point I is a vertex of the square, and point K is another vertex\", implying they are distinct from O1.\n\nSo we must assume that v is not parallel to E, so that I and K are not at O1.\n\nBut even if v is parallel, the dot product is still 0, but one vector is zero, so angle is undefined. So we exclude that case.\n\nIn all other cases, the angle is π/2.\n\nAnd since the problem likely assumes a non-degenerate case, the angle is π/2.\n\nMoreover, the answer is to be a multiple of π, and π/2 is fine.\n\nSo the measure of angle I–O1–K is **π/2 radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{2}}"
