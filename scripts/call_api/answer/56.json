  "answer": [
    "We are given a geometric construction involving two congruent regular (equilateral) triangles — one centered at O₁ and another at O₂ — with side length 1. The second triangle is obtained by translating the first triangle perpendicular to one of its sides. The composite figure has 8 labeled points and 8 line segments. We are told that:\n\n- M₀ is the midpoint of segment L₄\n- M₁ is the midpoint of segment L₀\n- We are to find the length of the segment connecting M₀ and M₁ — called Line_M₀_M₁.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup\n\nWe are told the initial triangle is regular (equilateral) with side length 1, centered at O₁. Then a congruent triangle is translated perpendicular to one of its sides to form a composite figure centered at O₂.\n\nThis suggests the two triangles are placed such that one is shifted perpendicularly from the other — likely forming a “butterfly” or “hourglass” shape, or perhaps a rhombus-like structure with overlapping or adjacent triangles.\n\nSince the triangles are congruent and one is translated perpendicular to a side, the displacement vector is perpendicular to one side of the triangle and of some length. But we are not told the distance of translation — so we must deduce it from the geometry of the composite figure and the labeled points.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the labeled points\n\nThe points labeled are:\n\n- A, B, C, D, E, F — likely vertices of the two triangles.\n- M₀, M₁ — midpoints of segments L₄ and L₀ respectively.\n- O₁, O₂ — centers of the two triangles.\n- L₃, L₄ — likely segments connecting points; but not defined explicitly.\n\nWe must deduce the positions of these points based on standard geometric constructions.\n\nLet’s try to reconstruct the figure.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Place the first triangle (centered at O₁)\n\nLet’s place the first equilateral triangle in the plane for simplicity.\n\nLet’s assume triangle ABC is equilateral, side length 1, centered at O₁.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the centroid (which coincides with the center) is located at the average of the vertices’ coordinates.\n\nLet’s place triangle ABC with:\n\n- Point B at (0, 0)\n- Point C at (1, 0)\n- Point A at (0.5, √3/2) — so that it’s equilateral.\n\nThen the centroid O₁ is at:\n\n> O₁ = ((0 + 1 + 0.5)/3, (0 + 0 + √3/2)/3) = (1.5/3, (√3/2)/3) = (0.5, √3/6)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Translate the triangle to form the second triangle\n\nWe are told the second triangle is translated perpendicular to one of its sides.\n\nLet’s assume we translate triangle ABC perpendicular to side BC (which is horizontal from (0,0) to (1,0)), so perpendicular direction is vertical — either up or down.\n\nBut since we already have point A above BC, and we want to form a composite figure, likely we translate **downward** to create a second triangle DEF below BC.\n\nLet’s assume the translation is by a distance such that the two triangles share the side BC? But then they would overlap on BC, and the composite figure would have 4 vertices: A, B, C, D (if D is the reflection of A over BC). But the problem says 8 labeled points — so likely the triangles do **not** share a side.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the translation is by a distance equal to the height of the triangle, so that the two triangles are separated but aligned.\n\nWait — let’s think differently.\n\nPerhaps the two triangles are arranged such that one is shifted perpendicular to a side by a distance equal to the height of the triangle, forming a hexagon or a star? But the problem says 8 points and 8 segments — so likely a quadrilateral-like composite with two triangles attached.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the second triangle is placed such that its base is aligned with the first triangle’s apex? Not clear.\n\nLet’s look at the points labeled: A, B, C, D, E, F — 6 points — and then M₀, M₁ — 2 more — total 8 points. So A–F are vertices of the two triangles, and M₀, M₁ are midpoints.\n\nAlso, O₁ and O₂ are centers — but they are not counted among the 8 labeled points? The problem says “8 labeled points” — probably referring to A, B, C, D, E, F, M₀, M₁.\n\nO₁ and O₂ are centers, but perhaps not counted as “labeled points” in the 8 — or maybe they are. The problem says: “a composite figure is formed containing 8 labeled points and 8 line segments.” Then lists points including O₁, O₂, etc. — but in the diagram, all red dots are labeled, including O₁, O₂, so perhaps the 8 points are: A, B, C, D, E, F, O₁, O₂? But then M₀ and M₁ are also labeled — so 10 points? Contradiction.\n\nWait — re-read:\n\n> “a composite figure is formed containing 8 labeled points and 8 line segments. Among these, M₀ is the midpoint of segment L₄, and M₁ is the midpoint of segment L₀.”\n\nSo the 8 labeled points include M₀ and M₁. So the 8 points are likely: A, B, C, D, E, F, M₀, M₁. O₁ and O₂ are centers, perhaps not counted as “labeled points” in the 8, or maybe they are — but the problem doesn’t specify.\n\nTo resolve this, let’s assume that the two triangles are placed such that:\n\n- First triangle: ABC, with BC horizontal, A above.\n- Second triangle: DEF, translated downward perpendicular to BC by a distance h, so that D is below B, E below C, F below A? But then it would be a translation, so DEF is congruent and parallel to ABC.\n\nBut then the composite figure would have 6 vertices, plus midpoints M₀ and M₁ — total 8 points.\n\nAlso, segments: probably the sides of the two triangles — 3 + 3 = 6 segments, plus 2 more segments — perhaps L₄ and L₀ — which are diagonals or connectors.\n\nBut we are told M₀ is midpoint of L₄, M₁ is midpoint of L₀.\n\nPerhaps L₄ and L₀ are segments connecting vertices of the two triangles.\n\nLet’s try to assign coordinates.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Assign coordinates to the first triangle\n\nLet’s place triangle ABC as before:\n\n- B = (0, 0)\n- C = (1, 0)\n- A = (0.5, √3/2)\n\nCentroid O₁ = (0.5, √3/6)\n\nNow, translate this triangle perpendicular to side BC. Since BC is horizontal, perpendicular is vertical. Let’s translate downward by a distance d.\n\nSo the second triangle DEF is:\n\n- D = (0, -d)\n- E = (1, -d)\n- F = (0.5, √3/2 - d)\n\nBut for the triangles to be congruent and not overlapping, d > 0.\n\nNow, the composite figure has points A, B, C, D, E, F — 6 points.\n\nWe need two more points: M₀ and M₁, midpoints of segments L₄ and L₀.\n\nWhat are L₄ and L₀? Not defined, but likely they are segments connecting vertices of the two triangles.\n\nCommon segments in such a construction might be:\n\n- From A to D\n- From A to E\n- From B to F\n- From C to F\n- From B to D (but that’s a side of the second triangle)\n- Perhaps L₀ is from A to E, and L₄ is from B to F, or something like that.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps L₀ and L₄ are the segments connecting the “corresponding” vertices, but since it's a translation, all vertices are shifted by the same vector.\n\nThe translation vector is (0, -d), so from A to F, B to D, C to E.\n\nSo segments like A to F, B to D, C to E are the translation vectors — vertical segments of length d.\n\nBut midpoints of those would be at (0.5, √3/4 - d/2), (0, -d/2), (1, -d/2) — not sure.\n\nPerhaps L₀ and L₄ are diagonals of the hexagon or something.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps the two triangles are arranged such that they share a common vertex or side, but the problem says \"translation\", so no sharing.\n\nLet’s look at the diagram description: it shows points A, B, C, D, E, F, with M₀, M₁, O₁, O₂.\n\nFrom the labels, it seems that:\n\n- A and D are top and bottom\n- B and E are left\n- C and F are right\n- O₁ is center of upper triangle\n- O₂ is center of lower triangle\n- M₁ is midpoint of L₀ — perhaps L₀ is from A to F or B to E\n- M₀ is midpoint of L₄ — perhaps L₄ is from B to F or A to E\n\nLet’s assume that L₀ is the segment from A to E, and L₄ is the segment from B to F.\n\nThen:\n\n- A = (0.5, √3/2)\n- E = (1, -d)\n- So M₁ = midpoint of A and E = ((0.5+1)/2, (√3/2 - d)/2) = (0.75, √3/4 - d/2)\n\n- B = (0, 0)\n- F = (0.5, √3/2 - d)\n- So M₀ = midpoint of B and F = ((0+0.5)/2, (0 + √3/2 - d)/2) = (0.25, √3/4 - d/2)\n\nThen the distance between M₀ and M₁ is:\n\nΔx = 0.75 - 0.25 = 0.5\n\nΔy = (√3/4 - d/2) - (√3/4 - d/2) = 0\n\nSo distance = 0.5\n\nOh! The y-coordinates are the same, so distance is just |0.75 - 0.25| = 0.5\n\nSo Line_M₀_M₁ = 0.5\n\nBut is this correct? We assumed L₀ is A to E, L₄ is B to F, and d is arbitrary, but it canceled out.\n\nIn this case, the y-coordinates of M₀ and M₁ are identical, so the distance is purely horizontal, 0.5.\n\nBut is this the intended construction?\n\nLet’s verify if this makes sense with the centers.\n\nO₁ = centroid of ABC = (0.5, √3/6)\n\nO₂ = centroid of DEF = (0.5, -d + √3/6)  [since DEF is ABC shifted down by d]\n\nThe vector from O₁ to O₂ is (0, -d)\n\nThe problem says the translation is perpendicular to one of its sides — which we took as BC, horizontal, so vertical translation — correct.\n\nNow, the midpoints M₀ and M₁ have the same y-coordinate, so the segment between them is horizontal, length 0.5.\n\nBut is d specified? In our calculation, d canceled out, so the distance is always 0.5, regardless of d.\n\nThat seems suspicious — but mathematically, it's correct for this assignment.\n\nPerhaps this is the intended configuration.\n\nAnother way to see it: the line joining M₀ and M₁ is parallel to the base BC, and halfway between the \"diagonals\" A-E and B-F.\n\nIn vector terms, M₀ = (B + F)/2, M₁ = (A + E)/2\n\nF = A + (0, -d)  [since F is A translated down by d]\n\nE = C + (0, -d) = (1,0) + (0,-d) = (1, -d)\n\nB = (0,0)\n\nA = (0.5, √3/2)\n\nSo M₀ = (B + F)/2 = ( (0,0) + (0.5, √3/2 - d) ) / 2 = (0.25, √3/4 - d/2)\n\nM₁ = (A + E)/2 = ( (0.5, √3/2) + (1, -d) ) / 2 = (1.5/2, (√3/2 - d)/2) = (0.75, √3/4 - d/2)\n\nDifference: (0.5, 0), so distance = 0.5\n\nYes.\n\nNow, is this consistent with the diagram? The diagram shows M₀ and M₁ at the same height, and horizontally separated.\n\nAlso, the problem mentions \"after one round of transformation\", and we have two triangles, so likely this is correct.\n\nMoreover, the answer is a constant 0.5, independent of the translation distance, which is elegant.\n\nPerhaps the translation distance is such that the triangles are separated by the height, but it doesn't matter.\n\nSo the length of Line_M₀_M₁ is 0.5.\n\nBut let's confirm the labeling.\n\nThe problem says: M₀ is midpoint of L₄, M₁ is midpoint of L₀.\n\nIn our assumption, L₄ is B to F, L₀ is A to E.\n\nIs there a reason to think otherwise?\n\nPerhaps L₀ and L₄ are different segments.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps L₀ is from C to D, and L₄ is from A to E, etc.\n\nLet’s try L₀ = C to D\n\nC = (1,0), D = (0, -d)  [since D is B translated down: B=(0,0) -> D=(0,-d)]\n\nSo M₁ = midpoint of C and D = ((1+0)/2, (0 + (-d))/2) = (0.5, -d/2)\n\nL₄ = say B to F: B=(0,0), F=(0.5, √3/2 - d)\n\nM₀ = (0.25, √3/4 - d/2)\n\nThen distance between M₀ and M₁:\n\nΔx = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25\n\nΔy = -d/2 - (√3/4 - d/2) = -√3/4\n\nDistance = sqrt( (0.25)^2 + (√3/4)^2 ) = sqrt( 0.0625 + 0.75/4 ) wait\n\n(√3/4)^2 = 3/16 = 0.1875\n\n(0.25)^2 = 0.0625\n\nSum = 0.25, sqrt(0.25) = 0.5\n\nAgain 0.5!\n\nInteresting.\n\nSo regardless of which diagonals we take, as long as they are \"crossing\" diagonals, the distance between midpoints is 0.5.\n\nLet me generalize.\n\nSuppose we have two congruent equilateral triangles, one translated by vector **v** perpendicular to a side.\n\nLet the first triangle have vertices P, Q, R.\n\nSecond triangle: P', Q', R' = P + **v**, Q + **v**, R + **v**.\n\nNow, consider two segments: say from P to Q', and from Q to P'.\n\nThen midpoint of P Q' is (P + Q')/2 = (P + Q + **v**)/2\n\nMidpoint of Q P' is (Q + P')/2 = (Q + P + **v**)/2\n\nSame point! So distance 0 — not good.\n\nBetter: take P to R', and Q to P'.\n\nMidpoint of P R' = (P + R')/2 = (P + R + **v**)/2\n\nMidpoint of Q P' = (Q + P + **v**)/2\n\nDifference: [ (P + R + **v**) - (Q + P + **v**) ] / 2 = (R - Q)/2\n\nSo distance = |R - Q| / 2\n\nBut |R - Q| is the side length, which is 1, so distance = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nExactly!\n\nSo in general, for any two corresponding segments that \"cross\", the distance between their midpoints is half the side length.\n\nIn this case, side length is 1, so distance is 0.5.\n\nThis is a general result.\n\nTherefore, regardless of the specific segments L₀ and L₄, as long as they are segments connecting a vertex of one triangle to a non-corresponding vertex of the other triangle (i.e., not the translation vector), and specifically, if they are such that the vector between midpoints is half the side vector, then distance is 0.5.\n\nIn our case, since the triangles are equilateral and translated perpendicularly, and the segments are likely chosen as such crossing diagonals, the distance is 0.5.\n\nSo the answer is 0.5.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed{0.5}"
