    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the original circle (center O1), with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle. The points D, E, and F are the points of tangency between the inner circle and the sides AB, BC, and CA, respectively. Point M_0 is the midpoint of segment BC (referred to as line L7 in the construction log). A line segment is drawn connecting point F to point M_0.\n\nDetermine the length of segment FM₀."

    "We are given a geometric construction with two concentric circles:\n\n- Inner circle: center O1, radius 5.\n- Outer circle: same center O1, radius 10 (obtained by scaling the inner circle by factor 2).\n\nTriangle ABC is **circumscribed about the inner circle** — meaning the inner circle is the **incircle** of triangle ABC. The vertices A, B, C lie on the outer circle (radius 10). So triangle ABC is inscribed in the outer circle and circumscribed about the inner circle — making it a **tangential triangle** (has an incircle) and also **cyclic** (inscribed in a circle). Such a triangle is called a **bicentric triangle**.\n\nPoints D, E, F are the points of tangency of the incircle with sides AB, BC, and CA respectively.\n\nM₀ is the midpoint of BC.\n\nWe are to find the length of segment FM₀.\n\n---\n\nLet’s analyze this step by step.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\nSince the incircle is centered at O1 and the circumcircle is centered at the same point O1, this implies that the triangle ABC is **equilateral**.\n\nWhy?\n\nIn general, for a triangle to have both its incircle and circumcircle concentric, it must be **equilateral**.\n\n> **Theorem**: The incenter and circumcenter of a triangle coincide if and only if the triangle is equilateral.\n\nSince the problem states that the incircle is centered at O1 and the circumcircle (on which A, B, C lie) is also centered at O1, then the incenter and circumcenter coincide → triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\nSo we can assume triangle ABC is equilateral.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Use properties of equilateral triangle\n\nIn an equilateral triangle:\n\n- All sides equal, all angles 60°.\n- Inradius (r) and circumradius (R) are related by:  \n  \\[\n  R = 2r\n  \\]\n  (This is a standard result for equilateral triangles.)\n\nIn our case:\n\n- Inradius r = 5 (given, radius of inner circle).\n- Circumradius R = 10 (given, radius of outer circle).\n\nThis matches perfectly: R = 2r → 10 = 2×5 → consistent.\n\nSo triangle ABC is equilateral with inradius 5 and circumradius 10.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Find side length of triangle ABC\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the relationship between side length (a) and inradius (r) is:\n\n\\[\nr = \\frac{a \\sqrt{3}}{6}\n\\]\n\nSolve for a:\n\n\\[\n5 = \\frac{a \\sqrt{3}}{6} \\Rightarrow a = \\frac{5 \\cdot 6}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{30}{\\sqrt{3}} = 10\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nSo each side of triangle ABC is \\( 10\\sqrt{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Coordinates setup (for calculation)\n\nTo compute FM₀, let’s place the triangle in coordinate plane for easier calculation.\n\nPlace the center O1 at the origin (0,0).\n\nIn an equilateral triangle with circumradius R = 10, we can place the vertices as follows:\n\n- Let vertex A be at (10, 0) — on the positive x-axis.\n- Since it’s equilateral, the other two vertices are at 120° and 240°.\n\nSo:\n\n- A: \\( (10, 0) \\)\n- B: \\( (10 \\cos 120^\\circ, 10 \\sin 120^\\circ) = \\left(10 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right), 10 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right) = (-5, 5\\sqrt{3}) \\)\n- C: \\( (10 \\cos 240^\\circ, 10 \\sin 240^\\circ) = \\left(10 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right), 10 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}\\right)\\right) = (-5, -5\\sqrt{3}) \\)\n\nLet’s verify distance AB:\n\nA = (10, 0), B = (-5, 5√3)\n\n\\[\nAB^2 = (10 - (-5))^2 + (0 - 5\\sqrt{3})^2 = 15^2 + (5\\sqrt{3})^2 = 225 + 75 = 300\n\\Rightarrow AB = \\sqrt{300} = 10\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\nGood — matches our earlier side length.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Find point F — point of tangency on side CA\n\nF is the point where the incircle touches side CA.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the points of tangency of the incircle with the sides are located at the **midpoints** of the sides.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause the incircle touches each side at a point that is equidistant from the two adjacent vertices — and in an equilateral triangle, due to symmetry, that point is the midpoint.\n\nSo, F is the midpoint of CA.\n\nSimilarly, D is midpoint of AB, E is midpoint of BC.\n\nLet’s confirm this with coordinates.\n\nFind midpoint of CA:\n\nC = (-5, -5√3), A = (10, 0)\n\nMidpoint F:\n\n\\[\nF_x = \\frac{-5 + 10}{2} = \\frac{5}{2} = 2.5\n\\]\n\\[\nF_y = \\frac{-5\\sqrt{3} + 0}{2} = -\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n\\]\n\nSo F = \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) \\)\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Find M₀ — midpoint of BC\n\nB = (-5, 5√3), C = (-5, -5√3)\n\nMidpoint M₀:\n\n\\[\nM_{0x} = \\frac{-5 + (-5)}{2} = -5\n\\]\n\\[\nM_{0y} = \\frac{5\\sqrt{3} + (-5\\sqrt{3})}{2} = 0\n\\]\n\nSo M₀ = (-5, 0)\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Compute distance FM₀\n\nF = \\( \\left( \\frac{5}{2}, -\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) \\), M₀ = (-5, 0)\n\nUse distance formula:\n\n\\[\nFM_0 = \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{5}{2} - (-5) \\right)^2 + \\left( -\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} - 0 \\right)^2 }\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n= \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{5}{2} + 5 \\right)^2 + \\left( -\\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)^2 }\n= \\sqrt{ \\left( \\frac{15}{2} \\right)^2 + \\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)^2 }\n\\]\n\nCompute each term:\n\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{15}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{225}{4}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{5\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)^2 = \\frac{25 \\cdot 3}{4} = \\frac{75}{4}\n\\]\n\nAdd:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{225}{4} + \\frac{75}{4} = \\frac{300}{4} = 75\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\nFM_0 = \\sqrt{75} = \\sqrt{25 \\cdot 3} = 5\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]"
