  "answer": [
    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two concentric circles centered at O1, with radii 10 (outer) and 5 (inner). An equilateral triangle ABC is inscribed in the outer circle (so its vertices lie on the circle of radius 10), and the inner circle (radius 5) is inscribed in triangle ABC — meaning it is tangent to all three sides of the triangle.\n\nWe are to find the length of the perpendicular from point B to line AC (denoted as line L3), and specifically, the foot of this perpendicular, B', lies on the *extension* of AC beyond point C. So we are to compute the length BB'.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle\n\nIn an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius R, the side length s is given by:\n\n> **Formula**: For an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle of radius R,  \n> **s = R × √3**\n\nWait — let’s double-check that.\n\nActually, in an equilateral triangle, the **circumradius R** is related to the side length s by:\n\n> **R = s / √3**\n\nWait — no, that’s not correct.\n\nLet me derive it properly.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle with side length s, the height h is:\n\n> h = (√3 / 2) * s\n\nThe centroid (which coincides with the circumcenter and incenter in an equilateral triangle) divides the height in a 2:1 ratio. So the distance from a vertex to the centroid (which is the circumradius R) is:\n\n> R = (2/3) * h = (2/3) * (√3 / 2) * s = (√3 / 3) * s = s / √3\n\nWait — that gives R = s / √3 → s = R√3.\n\nBut let’s verify with a known case.\n\nIf s = 2, then h = √3, circumradius R = (2/3)h = (2/3)√3 ≈ 1.1547.\n\nBut s / √3 = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.1547 — yes, matches.\n\nSo:\n\n> **s = R × √3**\n\nWait — no:\n\nFrom R = s / √3 → s = R × √3 — yes, that’s correct.\n\nWait — actually, let’s use the standard formula.\n\nStandard formula for circumradius R of equilateral triangle:\n\n> **R = s / (√3)** — no, that’s wrong.\n\nActually, the correct formula is:\n\n> **R = s / (√3) × something?**\n\nLet me recall:\n\nIn any triangle, R = abc / (4A)\n\nFor equilateral triangle: a = b = c = s, area A = (√3 / 4) s²\n\nSo R = (s * s * s) / (4 * (√3 / 4) s²) = s³ / (√3 s²) = s / √3\n\nYes! So:\n\n> **R = s / √3 → s = R √3**\n\nWait — s = R √3? Let’s plug in numbers.\n\nIf R = 10, then s = 10√3 ≈ 17.32\n\nBut let’s check with the height.\n\nHeight h = (√3 / 2) s = (√3 / 2)(10√3) = (10 * 3)/2 = 15\n\nThen circumradius R = (2/3) * h = (2/3)*15 = 10 — yes, correct.\n\nSo yes, for an equilateral triangle with circumradius R, side length s = R√3.\n\nWait — no: s = R * √3? From above: R = s / √3 → s = R * √3 — yes.\n\nSo for R = 10, s = 10√3.\n\nBut now, the problem says the inner circle (incircle) has radius 5.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the inradius r is:\n\n> r = (1/3) * h = (1/3) * (√3 / 2) s = (√3 / 6) s\n\nAlso, since R = s / √3, then s = R√3, so:\n\nr = (√3 / 6) * R√3 = (3 / 6) R = R / 2\n\nSo in an equilateral triangle, **inradius r = R / 2**\n\nIn our case, R = 10, so r = 5 — which matches the given inner circle radius.\n\nPerfect — so the configuration is consistent.\n\nSo triangle ABC is equilateral, side length s = 10√3, circumradius 10, inradius 5.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Set up coordinate system\n\nTo compute the perpendicular distance from B to line AC, and specifically the foot B' on the extension of AC beyond C, we can use coordinate geometry.\n\nLet’s place the triangle in the coordinate plane with center O1 at the origin (0,0).\n\nSince ABC is equilateral and inscribed in a circle of radius 10, we can place the points as follows:\n\nLet’s place point A at (10, 0) — on the positive x-axis.\n\nSince it’s equilateral, the other points are at 120° and 240°.\n\nSo:\n\n- Point A: (10, 0)\n- Point B: (10 cos 120°, 10 sin 120°) = (10*(-1/2), 10*(√3/2)) = (-5, 5√3)\n- Point C: (10 cos 240°, 10 sin 240°) = (10*(-1/2), 10*(-√3/2)) = (-5, -5√3)\n\nLet me verify the side lengths.\n\nDistance AB:\n\nA(10,0), B(-5, 5√3)\n\nΔx = -15, Δy = 5√3\n\nAB² = (-15)^2 + (5√3)^2 = 225 + 25*3 = 225 + 75 = 300 → AB = √300 = 10√3 — good.\n\nSimilarly, BC: B(-5,5√3), C(-5,-5√3)\n\nΔx = 0, Δy = -10√3 → BC = 10√3 — good.\n\nAC: A(10,0), C(-5,-5√3)\n\nΔx = -15, Δy = -5√3 → AC² = 225 + 75 = 300 → AC = 10√3 — good.\n\nPerfect.\n\nSo points:\n\n- A: (10, 0)\n- B: (-5, 5√3)\n- C: (-5, -5√3)\n\nLine L3 is segment AC.\n\nWe need to find the perpendicular from B to line AC, and find the foot B' on the *extension* of AC beyond C.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find the equation of line AC\n\nPoints A(10, 0) and C(-5, -5√3)\n\nSlope of AC:\n\nm = (y2 - y1)/(x2 - x1) = (-5√3 - 0)/(-5 - 10) = (-5√3)/(-15) = √3 / 3\n\nSo slope m = 1/√3 (since √3/3 = 1/√3)\n\nEquation of line AC: using point A(10,0)\n\ny - 0 = m(x - 10)\n\ny = (1/√3)(x - 10)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find the perpendicular from B to line AC\n\nThe slope of AC is m = 1/√3, so the slope of the perpendicular is the negative reciprocal: -√3\n\nSo the perpendicular from B(-5, 5√3) has slope -√3.\n\nEquation of perpendicular:\n\ny - 5√3 = -√3 (x + 5)\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Find intersection point B' of this perpendicular with line AC\n\nSet the two equations equal:\n\nLine AC: y = (1/√3)(x - 10)\n\nPerpendicular: y = -√3(x + 5) + 5√3\n\nSet equal:\n\n(1/√3)(x - 10) = -√3(x + 5) + 5√3\n\nMultiply both sides by √3 to eliminate denominators:\n\nx - 10 = -3(x + 5) + 5*3\n\nSimplify right side:\n\n-3(x + 5) + 15 = -3x -15 + 15 = -3x\n\nSo:\n\nx - 10 = -3x\n\nAdd 3x to both sides:\n\n4x - 10 = 0 → 4x = 10 → x = 10/4 = 2.5 = 5/2\n\nNow find y:\n\ny = (1/√3)(x - 10) = (1/√3)(5/2 - 10) = (1/√3)(-15/2) = -15/(2√3) = -5√3 / 2\n\nSo foot of perpendicular B' is at (5/2, -5√3 / 2)\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Check if B' lies on the extension of AC beyond C\n\nPoints on line AC: from A(10,0) to C(-5,-5√3)\n\nWe can parametrize line AC.\n\nVector from A to C: (-15, -5√3)\n\nSo parametric equations:\n\nx = 10 - 15t\n\ny = 0 - 5√3 t\n\nWhen t=0: A(10,0)\n\nWhen t=1: C(-5,-5√3)\n\nNow, our B' is at (2.5, -5√3 / 2)\n\nSet x = 10 - 15t = 2.5 → 15t = 7.5 → t = 0.5\n\nThen y = -5√3 * 0.5 = -2.5√3 = -5√3 / 2 — matches.\n\nSo t = 0.5, which is between A and C (since t=0 at A, t=1 at C), so B' is on segment AC, not on the extension beyond C.\n\nBut the problem says: “its foot lies on the extension of L3 beyond point C, denoted as point B'”\n\nThis contradicts our calculation.\n\nWhat’s wrong?\n\nWait — perhaps I misassigned the points.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, if I place A at (10,0), B at 120°, C at 240°, then the triangle is oriented with A on the right, B top-left, C bottom-left.\n\nLine AC goes from (10,0) to (-5,-5√3), which is down and left.\n\nPoint B is at (-5,5√3), which is top-left.\n\nThe perpendicular from B to AC — we found the foot at (2.5, -5√3/2), which is on AC between A and C.\n\nBut the problem says the foot is on the extension beyond C.\n\nThat suggests that perhaps the triangle is oriented differently, or I have misidentified which side is AC.\n\nWait — perhaps the perpendicular from B to AC falls outside the segment AC, beyond C.\n\nBut in our calculation, it fell at t=0.5, which is midpoint? Let’s see.\n\nt=0.5: halfway between A and C.\n\nBut geometrically, in an equilateral triangle, the perpendicular from a vertex to the opposite side should fall at the midpoint of the side — because it's also the altitude.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the altitude from B to AC should hit the midpoint of AC.\n\nLet’s compute the midpoint of AC.\n\nA(10,0), C(-5,-5√3)\n\nMidpoint: ((10-5)/2, (0 -5√3)/2) = (5/2, -5√3/2) — exactly the point we found.\n\nSo B' is the midpoint of AC — which is on the segment AC, not on the extension.\n\nBut the problem says: “its foot lies on the extension of L3 beyond point C”\n\nThis is a contradiction.\n\nUnless... perhaps I misread the problem.\n\nLet me reread:\n\n> “Line L3 is defined as the line segment AC. From point B, a perpendicular is dropped to line L3, and its foot lies on the extension of L3 beyond point C, denoted as point B'.”\n\nBut in an equilateral triangle, the foot of the perpendicular from B to AC is the midpoint of AC, which is between A and C, not beyond C.\n\nSo why does the problem say it lies beyond C?\n\nPerhaps the triangle is not oriented as I thought.\n\nMaybe the labeling is different.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps the triangle is labeled such that AC is not the side opposite B, but that doesn't make sense — in triangle ABC, side AC is opposite B.\n\nUnless... perhaps the perpendicular is not to the line segment, but to the line, and in some orientations, it might fall outside.\n\nBut in equilateral triangle, it always falls at the midpoint.\n\nUnless... wait a minute.\n\nPerhaps I have the points wrong.\n\nLet me plot mentally.\n\nPoint A(10,0), B(-5,5√3) ≈ (-5,8.66), C(-5,-8.66)\n\nSo AC is from (10,0) to (-5,-8.66), which is a line going left and down.\n\nB is at (-5,8.66), which is directly above C.\n\nThe line AC has slope ( -8.66 - 0 ) / ( -5 - 10 ) = (-8.66)/(-15) = 0.577, which is 1/√3, as before.\n\nThe perpendicular from B(-5,8.66) to this line.\n\nSince B is at x= -5, and C is also at x= -5, so BC is vertical.\n\nLine AC is not vertical; it has slope 1/√3.\n\nThe foot of the perpendicular from B to AC is at (2.5, -4.33), which is to the right of C.\n\nC is at (-5,-8.66), B' is at (2.5,-4.33), which is to the right and up from C, so on the line AC, but between A and C, not beyond C.\n\nTo be beyond C, it would have to be on the side of C away from A, so for t > 1 in our parametrization.\n\nBut we got t=0.5.\n\nSo why does the problem say it's beyond C?\n\nPerhaps there's a mistake in the problem, or in my understanding.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps \"line L3\" is defined as the line segment AC, but when we drop a perpendicular from B, it may not intersect the segment, but the line, and in this case, it does intersect the segment.\n\nBut the problem specifically says \"its foot lies on the extension of L3 beyond point C\", which implies it does not intersect the segment AC, but the line beyond C.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, that is impossible, because the altitude always hits the opposite side.\n\nUnless... perhaps the triangle is not equilateral? But the problem says it is.\n\nOr perhaps the circles are not concentric? But it says they are.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps the inner circle is not the incircle, but the problem says \"inscribed within triangle ABC, tangent to its sides\", so it is the incircle.\n\nAnd we verified that with R=10, r=5, which is correct for equilateral triangle.\n\nPerhaps the perpendicular is not to AC, but to another line.\n\nLet me read the problem again carefully.\n\n\"Line L3 is defined as the line segment AC. From point B, a perpendicular is dropped to line L3, and its foot lies on the extension of L3 beyond point C, denoted as point B'.\"\n\nBut in our calculation, it doesn't.\n\nUnless the triangle is labeled differently.\n\nPerhaps A, B, C are not in order around the circle.\n\nIn my setup, I have A at 0°, B at 120°, C at 240°, so going counter-clockwise: A, B, C.\n\nBut perhaps the triangle is labeled A, C, B or something.\n\nSuppose I swap B and C.\n\nLet me try: let B be at 240°, C at 120°.\n\nSo:\n\n- A: (10,0)\n- B: (-5, -5√3)  // 240°\n- C: (-5, 5√3)   // 120°\n\nThen line AC is from A(10,0) to C(-5,5√3)\n\nSlope of AC: (5√3 - 0)/(-5 - 10) = 5√3 / (-15) = -√3 / 3 = -1/√3\n\nEquation: y - 0 = (-1/√3)(x - 10)\n\nPerpendicular from B(-5, -5√3) to this line.\n\nSlope of perpendicular is the negative reciprocal of -1/√3, which is √3.\n\nSo equation: y +5√3 = √3 (x +5)\n\nSet equal to line AC:\n\n(-1/√3)(x - 10) = √3(x +5) -5√3\n\nMultiply both sides by √3:\n\n-1(x - 10) = 3(x +5) -15\n\n- x + 10 = 3x +15 -15 = 3x\n\nSo -x + 10 = 3x → 10 = 4x → x = 2.5\n\nThen y = (-1/√3)(2.5 - 10) = (-1/√3)(-7.5) = 7.5/√3 = 2.5√3\n\nSo B' is at (2.5, 2.5√3)\n\nNow, is this on the extension of AC beyond C?\n\nPoints A(10,0), C(-5,5√3)\n\nParametrize: from A to C: vector (-15, 5√3)\n\nx = 10 -15t\n\ny = 0 + 5√3 t\n\nSet x = 2.5: 10 -15t = 2.5 → 15t = 7.5 → t = 0.5\n\ny = 5√3 * 0.5 = 2.5√3 — matches.\n\nt=0.5, again between A and C.\n\nSame issue.\n\nPerhaps the perpendicular from B to AC is not the altitude, but in equilateral triangle, it is.\n\nUnless the triangle is not equilateral, but the problem says it is.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"line L3\" is not AC, but something else, but the problem says \"line L3 is defined as the line segment AC\".\n\nPerhaps \"from point B, a perpendicular is dropped to line L3\" means to the line, and in some configurations, but in equilateral, it's always on the segment.\n\nPerhaps the foot is on the extension beyond C for a different reason.\n\nLet's calculate the distance from B to line AC, and see if it matches the height.\n\nIn equilateral triangle with side s = 10√3, height h = (√3/2) * s = (√3/2)*10√3 = 10*3/2 = 15.\n\nSo the length of the perpendicular from B to AC should be 15.\n\nIn our calculation, distance from B(-5,5√3) to B'(2.5, -5√3/2)\n\nΔx = 2.5 - (-5) = 7.5\n\nΔy = -5√3/2 - 5√3 = -5√3/2 - 10√3/2 = -15√3/2\n\nSo distance BB' = sqrt( (7.5)^2 + ( -15√3/2 )^2 ) = sqrt( 56.25 + (225 * 3) / 4 ) = sqrt( 56.25 + 675/4 ) = sqrt( 56.25 + 168.75 ) = sqrt(225) = 15\n\nYes, so the length is 15, which is the height.\n\nBut the foot is on the segment, not on the extension.\n\nThe problem specifically says \"on the extension beyond point C\", which is not the case.\n\nPerhaps there is a typo in the problem, and it should be \"on the line AC\" or \"on the segment AC\", but it says \"extension beyond C\".\n\nMaybe for this particular configuration, if we consider the line AC, and drop perpendicular from B, it could be on the extension if the triangle is oriented differently, but in standard position, it's not.\n\nAnother possibility: perhaps \"line L3\" is not AC, but the problem says it is.\n\nOr perhaps \"from point B\" is not to AC, but to another line.\n\nLet me read the problem once more.\n\n\" a large circle centered at O1 with radius 10 circumscribes an equilateral triangle ABC, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the circle. A smaller concentric circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is inscribed within triangle ABC, tangent to its sides at points D, E, and F. Line L3 is defined as the line segment AC. From point B, a perpendicular is dropped to line L3, and its foot lies on the extension of L3 beyond point C, denoted as point B'.\"\n\nPerhaps in this configuration, with the incircle tangent at D,E,F, and the way it's drawn, but in our calculation, it's symmetric.\n\nPerhaps the perpendicular is not to the line AC, but to the line of the incircle or something, but no, it says to line L3, which is AC.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"line L3\" is the line, and \"extension beyond C\" is a mistake, and it should be \"on the line AC\", and we are to find the distance, which is 15.\n\nAnd in many problems, they ask for the length of the perpendicular, which is the height, 15.\n\nAnd the \"extension beyond C\" might be a red herring or a mistake.\n\nPerhaps for this specific labeling, if we consider the triangle with A, B, C in a different order.\n\nSuppose we place B at (10,0), A at 120°, C at 240°.\n\nLet me try that.\n\nLet B: (10,0)\n\nA: (10 cos 120°, 10 sin 120°) = (-5, 5√3)\n\nC: (10 cos 240°, 10 sin 240°) = (-5, -5√3)\n\nThen line L3 is AC, from A(-5,5√3) to C(-5,-5√3)\n\nThis is a vertical line at x = -5.\n\nThen from B(10,0), drop perpendicular to line AC, which is x = -5.\n\nThe perpendicular from B to this vertical line is horizontal, so y=0, x= -5.\n\nSo foot B' is at (-5,0)\n\nNow, is this on the extension of AC beyond C?\n\nAC is from A(-5,5√3) to C(-5,-5√3), so it's the vertical line x= -5, from y=5√3 to y= -5√3.\n\nB' is at (-5,0), which is on the segment AC, since 0 is between -5√3 and 5√3.\n\nStill not beyond C.\n\nC is at y= -5√3 ≈ -8.66, B' at y=0, which is above C, so on the segment.\n\nTo be beyond C, it would have to be at y < -5√3.\n\nBut the perpendicular from B(10,0) to the line x= -5 is at (-5,0), which is not below C.\n\nSo still not.\n\nPerhaps if we drop perpendicular from B to AC, but in this case AC is vertical, so perpendicular is horizontal, and it hits at (-5,0), which is the midpoint.\n\nSame thing.\n\nPerhaps the problem means from B to the line, and in some interpretation, but it's always on the segment.\n\nUnless the triangle is not acute, but it's equilateral, so acute.\n\nI think there might be a mistake in the problem statement, or perhaps \"beyond point C\" is a misstatement, and it should be \"on the line AC\".\n\nPerhaps \"extension\" is used loosely, but typically \"extension beyond C\" means on the line but not on the segment, on the side of C away from A.\n\nIn our case, for the first configuration, B' is at (2.5, -5√3/2) , C is at (-5, -5√3) , A is at (10,0)\n\nSo on the line, from A to C, B' is between A and C.\n\nTo be beyond C, it would be for t>1 in parametrization.\n\nBut in equilateral triangle, the foot is always at the midpoint.\n\nPerhaps for this problem, we are to assume that the foot is on the extension, and calculate accordingly, but that doesn't make sense.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"line L3\" is not AC, but the line of the incircle or something, but the problem says \"line segment AC\".\n\nPerhaps \"from point B\" is to a different line.\n\nLet's look at the diagram description.\n\nThe user provided a diagram, but since I can't see it, I have to rely on text.\n\nIn the text, it says: \"Line L3 is defined as the line segment AC\". and \"from point B, a perpendicular is dropped to line L3\".\n\nAnd \"its foot lies on the extension of L3 beyond point C\".\n\nBut in geometry, for equilateral triangle, this is impossible.\n\nUnless the triangle is not equilateral, but the problem says it is.\n\nPerhaps the large circle is not the circumcircle, but the problem says \"circumscribes\", so it is.\n\nAnother thought: perhaps \"inscribed within triangle ABC\" means something else, but it says \"tangent to its sides\", so it is the incircle.\n\nAnd we verified that with R=10, r=5, which is correct for equilateral.\n\nPerhaps the radius 5 is not the inradius, but the problem says it is inscribed and tangent to sides, so it is.\n\nI think the only logical conclusion is that the \"extension beyond C\" is a mistake, and we are to find the length of the perpendicular from B to AC, which is the height of the equilateral triangle, 15.\n\nAnd in our calculation, we got 15.\n\nSo perhaps the answer is 15.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, the labeling is such that B is not the vertex opposite AC, but the problem says triangle ABC, and L3 is AC, so B is the opposite vertex.\n\nPerhaps \"from point B\" is to line AC, but in the diagram, it's configured so that the foot is beyond C, but that would require the triangle to be obtuse, which it's not.\n\nUnless the circle is not the circumcircle, but the problem says it is.\n\nI think for the sake of solving, since the length is 15, and it's a nice number, and matches the height, I'll go with that.\n\nSo the length of BB' is 15.\n\nAnd box that.\n\nSo \\boxed{15}\n\nTo confirm, in equilateral triangle with circumradius R=10, height h = 3/2 * R? No.\n\nEarlier we had h = (√3/2) * s, s = R * √3 = 10√3, so h = (√3/2)*10√3 = 10*3/2 = 15, yes.\n\nAnd since the perpendicular from B to AC is the height, length is 15.\n\nSo regardless of where the foot is, the length is 15.\n\nAnd the problem asks for the length of segment BB', which is the distance from B to the line AC, which is 15.\n\nSo even if the foot is on the segment or on the extension, the length is the same.\n\nIn this case, it's on the segment, but the length is still 15.\n\nSo perhaps the \"extension beyond C\" is irrelevant for the length, or a misstatement.\n\nSo I think the answer is 15. \n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\boxed{15}"
