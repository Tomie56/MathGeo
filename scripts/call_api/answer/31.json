    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric regular hexagons: an outer one with side length 5, and an inner one scaled by 1/2, both centered at point O1. The outer hexagon has vertices A, B, C, D, E, F in counterclockwise order. The inner hexagon has vertices G, H, I, J, K, L, with L coinciding with M_0, the midpoint of side DE of the outer hexagon.\n\nWe are asked to find the **radian measure of angle ∠B-A-F**, i.e., the angle at vertex A between segments AB and AF.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular hexagon\n\nIn a **regular hexagon**, all sides are equal, and all internal angles are 120° (or 2π/3 radians). But here, we are not being asked for an internal angle of the hexagon — we are being asked for the angle **at vertex A between segments AB and AF**.\n\nLet’s clarify: In a regular hexagon labeled A, B, C, D, E, F counterclockwise, the vertices are arranged in order around the center. So from vertex A, the adjacent vertices are B and F (since it’s cyclic: ...F-A-B...).\n\nTherefore, **∠B-A-F** is the **internal angle at vertex A** of the regular hexagon.\n\nWait — let’s confirm this.\n\nIn polygon terminology, the internal angle at vertex A is the angle between the two edges meeting at A — which are AB and AF (since F is the previous vertex and B is the next vertex in counterclockwise order).\n\n✅ So ∠B-A-F is indeed the **internal angle** of the regular hexagon at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Recall the internal angle of a regular hexagon\n\nFor any regular polygon with n sides, the internal angle is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{n}\n\\]\n\nFor a hexagon, n = 6:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{(6 - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{6} = \\frac{4\\pi}{6} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider if the rotation or inner hexagon affects this angle\n\nThe problem mentions that the outer hexagon is rotated by π/6 radians, and there’s an inner scaled hexagon. However, **rotation does not change internal angles** — it only changes orientation. Similarly, the inner hexagon and the line from I to M_0 are part of the construction, but **they are irrelevant to the angle ∠B-A-F**, which is purely a property of the outer hexagon’s geometry at vertex A.\n\nThe angle ∠B-A-F is determined solely by the positions of points B, A, and F — which are vertices of the regular hexagon. Since the hexagon is regular, the angle is fixed regardless of rotation or scaling of other elements.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThus, the radian measure of angle ∠B-A-F is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n✅ **Note**: The problem may have included extra information (rotation, inner hexagon, point I, M_0) to distract or to set up a more complex problem — but the specific question asks only for ∠B-A-F, which is a standard internal angle of a regular hexagon. No further computation is needed.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{2\\pi}{3}}\n\\]"
