    "We are told:\n\n- There is a **regular octagon** centered at **O1**, with **side length 3**.\n- A **square** is centered at **point E**, with **one of its vertices at O1**, and its **radius equal to that of the octagon**.\n- After one round of derivation, **12 total points** are identified, including intersections.\n- There are **16 resulting line segments**, and we are to find the length of **segment H–O1**, which is explicitly constructed in the final step.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the geometry of the regular octagon\n\nA regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal angles. It can be inscribed in a circle (circumcircle), and the distance from the center to any vertex is the **circumradius R**.\n\nGiven: side length **s = 3**\n\nWe need to compute the **circumradius R** of a regular octagon with side length 3.\n\n### Formula for circumradius R of a regular octagon:\n\n> For a regular octagon with side length **s**, the circumradius **R** is:\n> \n> $$\nR = \\frac{s}{2 \\sin(\\pi/8)}\n$$\n\nWe know:\n- $ \\sin(\\pi/8) = \\sin(22.5^\\circ) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos(45^\\circ)}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2} $\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{3}{2 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}} = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nWe can rationalize this or leave it for now — but perhaps we can compute numerically for clarity.\n\nCompute numerically:\n\n- $ \\sqrt{2} \\approx 1.4142 $\n- $ 2 - \\sqrt{2} \\approx 0.5858 $\n- $ \\sqrt{0.5858} \\approx 0.7654 $\n- So $ R \\approx \\frac{3}{0.7654} \\approx 3.918 $\n\nSo the circumradius of the octagon is approximately **3.918**.\n\nBut let’s keep it symbolic for accuracy.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: The square centered at E with one vertex at O1, and radius equal to that of the octagon\n\nThis means:\n\n- The square is centered at point **E**.\n- One of its **vertices** is at **O1**.\n- The **radius** of the square (i.e., distance from center E to any vertex) is equal to the octagon’s circumradius R.\n\nSo, the square has circumradius R, same as the octagon.\n\nIn a square, the distance from center to a vertex is $ \\frac{s_{\\text{square}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{s_{\\text{square}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}}{2} $? Wait — let's be precise.\n\nActually, for a square with side length **a**, the distance from center to a vertex is:\n\n> $ R_{\\text{square}} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{a \\sqrt{2}}{2} $? No — wait.\n\nActually, if a square has side length **a**, then the diagonal is $ a\\sqrt{2} $, so the distance from center to vertex is **half the diagonal**:\n\n> $ R_{\\text{square}} = \\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2} = \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} $\n\nSo if the square has circumradius R, then:\n\n> $ \\frac{a}{\\sqrt{2}} = R \\Rightarrow a = R \\sqrt{2} $\n\nBut we don’t need the side length of the square — we need to understand the position of point E and how H relates to O1.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Analyze the configuration\n\nWe are told that after one round of derivation, 12 points are identified, including intersections, and 16 line segments are formed. Segment H–O1 is explicitly constructed in the final step.\n\nWe are to find the length of **H–O1**.\n\nLooking at the diagram (even though we can’t see it, we can infer from the labels and description):\n\n- The octagon is centered at O1.\n- The square is centered at E, with one vertex at O1.\n- So, point O1 is a **vertex** of the square, and E is its center.\n- Therefore, the vector from E to O1 is a radius vector of the square, length R.\n\nSo, the distance **E to O1** is R.\n\nNow, what is point H?\n\nFrom the diagram labels (which we can reconstruct from the point names):\n\nPoints labeled: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, O1 — that’s 12 points.\n\nThe octagon likely has vertices: A, B, C, D, H, G, F, E? Or some permutation.\n\nBut note: the square is centered at E, with vertex at O1.\n\nAlso, segment H–O1 is explicitly constructed.\n\nPossibility: H is a vertex of the octagon, and O1 is the center — so H–O1 is a **radius** of the octagon.\n\nWait — if H is a vertex of the octagon, and O1 is the center, then **H–O1 = R**, the circumradius.\n\nBut then why go through all this description about the square? Maybe H is not a vertex of the octagon.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps H is a vertex of the square?\n\nLet’s think differently.\n\nThe square is centered at E, with vertex at O1. So, the square has 4 vertices: one is O1, and others are at 90° rotations around E.\n\nSo, if we consider E as center, and O1 as one vertex, then the other vertices are obtained by rotating O1 around E by 90°, 180°, 270°.\n\nSo, if we denote vector EO1, then the other vertices are at E + rot90(EO1), etc.\n\nNow, point H might be one of those vertices? But then H–O1 would be the distance between two adjacent vertices of the square — which is the side length of the square.\n\nWait — distance between two adjacent vertices of the square is **a**, and we know:\n\n> $ a = R \\sqrt{2} $\n\nBut if H and O1 are adjacent vertices of the square, then H–O1 = a = R√2.\n\nBut is that the case?\n\nAlternatively, if H is the vertex opposite to O1 in the square, then H–O1 would be the diagonal of the square = 2R.\n\nBut that seems too long.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps H is a vertex of the octagon, and we are to find the distance from H to O1 — which would be R.\n\nBut then why mention the square?\n\nWait — the problem says: “After one round of derivation, 12 total points are identified, including intersections.”\n\nSo, likely, the square and octagon intersect, and new points (intersections) are created, and H is one of those intersection points.\n\nSo, H is **not** a vertex of the octagon or square, but an **intersection point** of some lines from the square and octagon.\n\nThen, we need to compute the distance from H to O1.\n\nThis is getting complex without a diagram.\n\nBut let’s look for a different approach.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Re-express the problem with coordinates\n\nLet’s place the figure on the coordinate plane to compute distances.\n\n### Place O1 at the origin: O1 = (0, 0)\n\nThe regular octagon is centered at O1, side length 3.\n\nWe can place its vertices at angles 22.5°, 67.5°, ..., etc.\n\nBut we don’t need all vertices — we need to find point H.\n\nNow, the square is centered at E, with one vertex at O1 = (0,0), and radius R (same as octagon’s circumradius).\n\nSo, let’s find coordinates of E.\n\nSince O1 is a vertex of the square, and E is the center, then E lies along the line from O1 to the center, at distance R from O1? No — wait.\n\nIf O1 is a vertex of the square, and E is the center, then the vector from E to O1 has length R, and direction — let’s assume for simplicity that the square is oriented with sides parallel to axes or at 45°.\n\nBut to make it simple, let’s assume that the square is oriented such that the line from E to O1 is along the x-axis.\n\nSo, let’s set:\n\n- O1 = (0, 0)\n- E = (-R, 0)  [since O1 is a vertex, and E is center, so if we go from E to O1, it’s +R in x-direction]\n\nThen, the square has center at E = (-R, 0), and vertices at:\n\n- O1 = (0, 0)  [which is E + (R, 0)]\n- Other vertices by rotating (R, 0) around E by 90°, 180°, 270°.\n\nSo, rotating vector (R, 0) by 90° CCW around E: new vector is (0, R), so vertex at E + (0, R) = (-R, R)\n\nSimilarly:\n\n- 180°: (-R, 0) + (-R, 0) = (-2R, 0)\n- 270°: (-R, 0) + (0, -R) = (-R, -R)\n\nSo square vertices: (0,0), (-R, R), (-2R, 0), (-R, -R)\n\nNow, the octagon is centered at O1 = (0,0), with circumradius R.\n\nIts vertices are at angles θ = 22.5° + k*45°, for k=0 to 7.\n\nSo, for example:\n\n- Vertex at 22.5°: (R cos22.5°, R sin22.5°)\n- Vertex at 67.5°: (R cos67.5°, R sin67.5°)\n- etc.\n\nNow, the \"derivation\" likely involves drawing lines between these points or extending sides, and finding intersections.\n\nThe problem says: \"12 total points are identified, including intersections\" — so besides the 8 octagon vertices and 4 square vertices, there are no new points? 8+4=12 — so perhaps no additional intersection points? But it says \"including intersections\", implying there are some.\n\nWait — 8 octagon vertices + 4 square vertices = 12 points — so perhaps the 12 points are exactly these, and \"intersections\" might be a red herring, or perhaps some vertices coincide? Unlikely.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the square and octagon share some vertices? But the square has vertex at O1, which is the center of the octagon — not a vertex of the octagon. So no overlap.\n\nSo 8 + 4 = 12 points — so the 12 points are the 8 octagon vertices and 4 square vertices.\n\nThen, among the 16 line segments, H–O1 is one.\n\nNow, which point is H? From the diagram labels, H is likely one of the octagon vertices.\n\nIn many such diagrams, the octagon vertices are labeled consecutively: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H — so H is the 8th vertex.\n\nSimilarly, the square has vertices: O1, and say D, F, H? But in the diagram, D, F, H are labeled, and also E is the center of the square.\n\nLooking at the diagram description: points include I, J, K, etc.\n\nPerhaps H is a vertex of the octagon.\n\nIf H is a vertex of the octagon, then distance from H to O1 is R, the circumradius.\n\nBut then why mention the square? And why say \"explicitly constructed in the final step\"?\n\nPerhaps H is not a vertex of the octagon, but of the square.\n\nLet’s assume H is a vertex of the square.\n\nFrom earlier, square vertices are: O1=(0,0), (-R,R), (-2R,0), (-R,-R)\n\nSo if H is, say, (-R,R), then distance from H to O1 is distance between (0,0) and (-R,R) = √[(-R)^2 + R^2] = √(2R^2) = R√2\n\nSimilarly, if H is (-2R,0), distance to O1 is 2R.\n\nIf H is (-R,-R), same as (-R,R), distance R√2.\n\nNow, which one is it?\n\nThe problem says \"the segment connecting points H and O1 is explicitly constructed in the final step\" — implying it's not a side of the square or octagon, but a new segment.\n\nBut if H is a square vertex, and O1 is also a square vertex, then H–O1 is a side or diagonal of the square.\n\nIn our coordinate system, if H is (-R,R), then H–O1 is from (0,0) to (-R,R), which is a side of the square? Let's see the square vertices: (0,0), (-R,R), (-2R,0), (-R,-R)\n\nDistance between (0,0) and (-R,R): √(R^2 + R^2) = R√2\n\nDistance between (-R,R) and (-2R,0): √[(-R)^2 + (-R)^2] = R√2 — same.\n\nDistance between (0,0) and (-2R,0): 2R — diagonal.\n\nSo the sides are R√2, diagonal is 2R.\n\nSo if H–O1 is a side, length R√2; if diagonal, 2R.\n\nBut which is it?\n\nPerhaps from the diagram, H is adjacent to O1 in the square.\n\nIn many such problems, the square is inscribed or something, but here it's not.\n\nAnother idea: perhaps \"radius equal to that of the octagon\" means the distance from center to side, not to vertex? But the problem says \"radius\", and for polygons, \"radius\" usually means circumradius, especially since it's compared to the octagon's radius.\n\nMoreover, it says \"with its radius equal to that of the octagon\", and the octagon's radius is circumradius.\n\nSo we stick with R.\n\nNow, let's calculate R exactly.\n\nFrom earlier:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nLet's rationalize or simplify.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}:\n\nNote that (2 - √2)(2 + √2) = 4 - 2 = 2\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}} = 3 \\sqrt{\\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2}} = 3 \\sqrt{1 + \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}\n$$\n\nAlternatively, leave as:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{3}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nBut perhaps for the distance H–O1, if it's R√2, then:\n\n$$\nH-O1 = R \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n$$\n\nSimplify:\n\n$$\n= 3 \\sqrt{2} / \\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} = 3 \\sqrt{ \\frac{2}{2 - \\sqrt{2}} }\n$$\n\nRationalize the denominator inside:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{2 - \\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\frac{2 + \\sqrt{2}}{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\frac{2(2 + \\sqrt{2})}{(2)^2 - (\\sqrt{2})^2} = \\frac{2(2 + \\sqrt{2})}{4 - 2} = \\frac{2(2 + \\sqrt{2})}{2} = 2 + \\sqrt{2}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nH-O1 = 3 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}\n$$\n\nOh! That's a nice simplification.\n\nSo if H–O1 = R√2, then it is 3√(2 + √2)\n\nIs this the answer?\n\nLet me verify with numbers.\n\nEarlier, R ≈ 3.918, so R√2 ≈ 3.918 * 1.4142 ≈ 5.545\n\nNow, 3√(2 + √2) = 3√(2 + 1.4142) = 3√3.4142 ≈ 3*1.847 = 5.541 — matches.\n\nNow, is this the distance?\n\nBut is H–O1 really R√2?\n\nIn our coordinate system, if H is (-R,R), and O1 is (0,0), then yes, distance is R√2.\n\nAnd in the diagram, if the square is oriented with vertices at (0,0), (-R,R), etc., then H could be (-R,R).\n\nMoreover, the problem says \"after one round of derivation\", and \"16 line segments\" — perhaps the 16 segments are the sides of the octagon (8) and the square (4), and then 4 diagonals or something, but 8+4=12, not 16.\n\nPerhaps the 16 segments are all the lines between the 12 points, but that would be C(12,2)=66, too many.\n\nPerhaps only specific segments are drawn.\n\nBut the key is that H–O1 is explicitly constructed, and in our assumption, it is a side of the square, length R√2 = 3√(2 + √2)\n\nPerhaps H is a vertex of the octagon, and H–O1 = R = 3 / √(2 - √2) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √2? Let's see.\n\nFrom earlier, R = 3 / √(2 - √2) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √2, because:\n\nFrom earlier calculation:\n\nR = 3 √( (2 + √2)/2 ) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nSo if H–O1 = R, then it is 3 √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nBut that is approximately 3*1.847/1.414 ≈ 5.541/1.414 ≈ 3.918, which is R.\n\nBut earlier we have R√2 ≈ 5.545, which is different.\n\nSo which one is it?\n\nPerhaps from the diagram, H is not a vertex of the square or octagon, but an intersection point.\n\nFor example, perhaps a side of the square intersects a side of the octagon at H, and we need to find distance from H to O1.\n\nThat would be more complex, but possible.\n\nLet's try to find if there is a standard configuration.\n\nAnother thought: in some geometric constructions, when you have a regular octagon and a square sharing the same circumradius, and the square is rotated 22.5° or something, but here the square has a vertex at the center of the octagon, which is unusual.\n\nPerhaps \"radius\" for the square means something else.\n\nLet's read the problem again: \"a square centered at point E is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1, with its radius equal to that of the octagon.\"\n\n\"Radius\" for a square could mean the distance from center to side (inradius), or to vertex (circumradius).\n\nIn the context, \"radius equal to that of the octagon\" — for the octagon, radius usually means circumradius, so likely the same for the square.\n\nMoreover, if it were inradius, then for a square, inradius r = a/2, circumradius R = a/√2, so r = R / √2, but the problem says \"radius equal\", so likely circumradius.\n\nSo we stick with that.\n\nPerhaps in the diagram, point H is the vertex of the square that is adjacent to O1, so H–O1 is a side of the square, length a = R√2 = 3√(2 + √2)\n\nAnd this is a nice expression, and matches the numerical value.\n\nMoreover, 3√(2 + √2) is a standard expression for the diagonal of a square with side related to octagon, etc.\n\nPerhaps this is the answer.\n\nTo confirm, let's see if there's another interpretation.\n\nSuppose H is a vertex of the octagon. Then H–O1 = R = 3 / √(2 - √2) = 3 √(2 + √2) / √2\n\nBut this is not as nice, and the problem might expect a simpler form.\n\n3√(2 + √2) is simpler.\n\nPerhaps the answer is 3√(2 + √2)\n\nLet me box that.\n\nBut let's make sure.\n\nAnother way: in a regular octagon with side length s, the distance from center to vertex is R = s / (2 sin(22.5°)) = s / (2 * sin(π/8))\n\nAnd sin(π/8) = sin22.5° = √((1 - cos45°)/2) = √((1 - √2/2)/2) = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo R = s / (2 * √(2 - √2)/2) = s / √(2 - √2)\n\nAs before.\n\nNow, for the square, if it has circumradius R, then side length a = R * √2\n\nThen distance between two adjacent vertices is a = R√2 = s √2 / √(2 - √2) = s √(2 / (2 - √2)) = s √(2(2 + √2)/ ((2 - √2)(2 + √2)) ) = s √(2(2 + √2)/2) = s √(2 + √2)\n\nSince s=3, so distance = 3 √(2 + √2)\n\nSo if H and O1 are adjacent vertices of the square, then H–O1 = 3 √(2 + √2)\n\nGiven that the problem mentions \"the segment connecting points H and O1 is explicitly constructed in the final step\", and in many such problems, this is the case, I think this is the intended answer.\n\nSo, the measurement of Line_H_O1 is \\( 3\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} \\)\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{3\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]"
