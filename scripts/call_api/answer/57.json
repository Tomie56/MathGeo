    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric circles centered at O1, with radii 10 (larger) and 5 (smaller). An equilateral triangle ABC is inscribed in the larger circle (so A, B, C lie on the circle of radius 10). Points D, E, F lie on the smaller circle and are located on segments AB, BC, and AC respectively. There is also a perpendicular from B to the extension of line BC — but since it meets at B itself, this seems to be a red herring or misstatement, as the foot of the perpendicular from B to line BC is always B (since B lies on BC).\n\nBut the key question is:\n\n> What is the measure of angle BAC (∠B-A-C) in radians? Express your answer as a multiple of π.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Recognize the triangle is equilateral\n\nThe problem explicitly states: “an equilateral triangle ABC”. So, by definition, all internal angles of an equilateral triangle are equal.\n\nIn any triangle, the sum of internal angles is π radians (180 degrees). Therefore, each angle in an equilateral triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nSo, angle BAC = ∠B-A-C = π/3 radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm that the circle being circumscribed doesn’t change this\n\nThe triangle is inscribed in a circle (circumscribed by the circle), which is always possible for any triangle — and for an equilateral triangle, the circumcenter coincides with the centroid and orthocenter. The radius of the circumcircle is given as 10, but that doesn’t affect the angle measures — angles are intrinsic to the triangle’s shape.\n\nThe smaller circle and points D, E, F are mentioned, but the question is only about angle BAC. Since ABC is equilateral, angle BAC is fixed at π/3 regardless of other constructions.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Address the red herring about the perpendicular\n\nThe problem says: “A perpendicular is drawn from point B to the extension of line BC (labeled as L3), meeting it at point B itself (i.e., the foot coincides with B).”\n\nThis is trivially true — the perpendicular from a point to a line it lies on is the point itself. So this adds no new information and does not affect angle BAC.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n\\]"
