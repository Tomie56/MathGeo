    "In the given geometric construction, a regular octagon centered at O1 with side length 3 is the base figure. A square centered at point E is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1, such that the square’s radius equals the circumradius of the octagon. Point I lies on a side of the square, and point E is the center of the square. Segment IE connects these two points.\n\nFind the length of segment IE."
