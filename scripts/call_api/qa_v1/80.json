    "In the given diagram, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 contains an inscribed triangle ABC, where vertices A, B, and C lie on the circle. Point M_0 is the midpoint of chord BC. Segment BM_0 is drawn, connecting vertex B to M_0. Given this configuration, and using vector methods (dot product) to compute the angle at vertex A formed by segments AB and AC, determine the measure of ∠BAC in radians, expressed as a multiple of π."
