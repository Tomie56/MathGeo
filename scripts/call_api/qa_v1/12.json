    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O₁ with side length 1 is initially positioned. After one round of derivation involving a translation perpendicular to one of its sides, a second congruent triangle centered at O₂ is formed. The final figure comprises 8 labeled points (A, B, C, D, E, F, M₀, M₁) and 8 line segments, including the segment connecting midpoints M₀ (of segment AB) and M₁ (of segment EC). \n\nGiven that point A is a shared vertex of both triangles, and angle ∠BAC is formed by segments AB and AC, compute the radian measure of ∠BAC using vector methods (dot product), expressing your answer as a multiple of π in simplest form."
