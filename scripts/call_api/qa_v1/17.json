    "Two circles of equal radius 5 intersect such that the center of the lower circle is O₁ and the center of the upper circle is O₂. The circles intersect at two points, labeled A and B. Arc_circle_2_A refers to the arc of the upper circle (centered at O₂) that starts at point A and follows the circle’s circumference in the counterclockwise direction to the next significant point along the arc (typically the other intersection point B, unless otherwise specified). Given the symmetric configuration and equal radii, what is the measurement of Arc_circle_2_A?"
