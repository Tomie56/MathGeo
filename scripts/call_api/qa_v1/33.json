    "Consider a regular hexagon centered at point O1 with side length 5, rotated by π/6 radians. A second, concentric regular hexagon is inscribed within it, scaled by a factor of 1/2, sharing the same center O1. The outer hexagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in counterclockwise order, and the inner hexagon has vertices labeled G, H, I, J, K, L (also counterclockwise), with G lying on segment AB, H on BC, and so on. Point A is a vertex of the outer hexagon, and point F is the adjacent vertex in the clockwise direction. Point B is the adjacent vertex in the counterclockwise direction.\n\nWhat is the measure of angle B-A-F, formed by segments AB and AF at vertex A, expressed in radians as a multiple of π?"
