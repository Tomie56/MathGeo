    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 5 is first circumscribed by another regular pentagon (also centered at O1), and then a third regular pentagon is inscribed within the second, maintaining the same center. This yields a nested configuration of three concentric regular pentagons. Eleven distinct points are identified, including vertices and intersections. In the final step, a line segment is drawn from vertex A (a vertex of the outermost pentagon) to M_0, the midpoint of side L0 (a side of the outermost pentagon). \n\nFind the length of segment AM₀."
