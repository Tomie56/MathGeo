    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 5 is initially rotated by π/5 radians. Two successive “circum_inscribe” operations are applied, resulting in a circumscribed pentagon followed by an inscribed pentagon, both sharing center O1. The final figure comprises 11 labeled points (A through J and O1), 10 line segments, and no arcs. In the first enhancement round, segment JH is drawn, connecting two existing points on polygon edges.\n\nGiven this configuration, determine the radian measure of ∠B-A-E — the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AE — using vector dot product methods. Express your answer in exact radian form, without decimal approximation."
