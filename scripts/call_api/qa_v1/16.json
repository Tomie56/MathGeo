    "Two circles of equal radius 5 intersect such that their centers, O₁ and O₂, lie on each other’s circumference. Let point A be one of the two intersection points of the circles. Calculate the length of the arc of the upper circle (centered at O₂) from point A to the other intersection point, traversing the minor arc."
