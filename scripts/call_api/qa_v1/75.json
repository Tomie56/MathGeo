    "In the given diagram, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 contains an inscribed triangle ABC. A perpendicular is drawn from point C to chord AB, meeting AB at foot F₀. Using vector geometry, express the measure of angle ∠BAC — formed by segments AB and AC at vertex A — as a radian expression in terms of π."
