    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O₁ with side length 1 is rotated by π/3 radians. Following one round of translation—where a congruent triangle centered at O₂ is translated perpendicular to its first side—eight total points are formed, including intersections. Two new line segments are added by splitting, resulting in a total of eight line segments and no arcs. In the final configuration, points D and B lie on existing segments, and segment DB is explicitly drawn.\n\nFind the length of segment DB."
