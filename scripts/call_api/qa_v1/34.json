    "A regular hexagon with center O1 and side length 5 is given. A second, smaller regular hexagon, concentric with the first and scaled by a factor of 1/2, is inscribed within it. The outer hexagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in counterclockwise order, starting from the rightmost vertex. Point A and point B are adjacent vertices of the outer hexagon. Calculate the length of line segment AB."
