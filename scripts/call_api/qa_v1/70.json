    "In the given diagram, triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle centered at O1 with radius 5. Point C lies on the circle, and line L1 is the line segment AB. A perpendicular is drawn from point C to line L1, meeting L1 at point C (i.e., the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB coincides with point C itself, implying that point C lies on AB and the perpendicular is degenerate).\n\nWhat is the length of Line_C_C?"
