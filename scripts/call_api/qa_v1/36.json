    "In the given geometric construction, a regular hexagon centered at O1 with side length 5 is drawn, rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scaled by 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. The two hexagons together define 13 distinct points, including vertices and intersections. In the first and only enhancement round, a line segment is drawn connecting vertex I of the inner hexagon to M_0, the midpoint of side L3 (which corresponds to side DE of the outer hexagon). \n\nWhat is the length of segment IM_0?"
