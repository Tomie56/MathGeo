Concentric derivation: circle (center O1) scaled by 2 (new radius 10). Round 2: applying 'circum_inscribe' rule. Circumscribed 3-sided polygon (center O1) around circle. Found 8 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 6 new lines and 7 new arcs generated by splitting.

    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the original circle, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle. Points D, E, and F are points of tangency or intersection along the triangle’s sides and the inner circle. Point M_0 is the midpoint of segment CA. In a subsequent enhancement step, segment FM_0 is drawn.\n\nGiven this configuration, what is the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AC — expressed as a multiple of π?"
