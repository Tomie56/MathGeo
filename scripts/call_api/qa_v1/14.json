    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 1 is initially positioned. After one round of derivation involving a translation perpendicular to one side, a second congruent triangle centered at O2 is formed. The figure contains 8 labeled points: A, B, C, D, E, F, M₀ (midpoint of segment AB), and M₁ (midpoint of segment EF). In the final configuration, segments AB, AC, BC, CD, DE, EF, FC, and M₀M₁ are drawn, with no arcs present.\n\nDetermine the radian measure of the angle ∠BAC formed at vertex A by the intersection of lines AB and AC. Express your answer as an exact multiple of π, using vector dot product methods if necessary."
