    "In the given geometric construction, a regular hexagon centered at point O1 with side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. The outer hexagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in counterclockwise order, and the inner hexagon has vertices labeled G, H, I, J, K, L (with L coinciding with point M_0, the midpoint of side DE of the outer hexagon). In the single enhancement round, a line is drawn connecting vertex I of the inner hexagon to point M_0.\n\nFind the radian measure of angle ∠B-A-F — the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AF — expressed as a multiple of π."
