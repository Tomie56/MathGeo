    "In the given geometric construction, two congruent equilateral triangles are positioned such that triangle ABC (centered at O₁) and triangle DEF (centered at O₂) share a common vertex C, and point F₀ lies on segment AC such that BF₀ is perpendicular to AC. All sides of the triangles have length 1. The configuration is derived from a single translation operation applied perpendicular to side AB, resulting in 8 total labeled points and 8 line segments with no arcs.\n\nFind the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AC — expressed as a multiple of π."
