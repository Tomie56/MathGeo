    "Consider a regular pentagon centered at point O1 with side length 5, rotated by π/5 radians. Two successive “circum_inscribe” operations are applied, yielding a nested configuration of circumscribed and inscribed pentagons, resulting in a total of 11 labeled points and 10 line segments. In the final configuration, a perpendicular is drawn from point E to line L7, meeting its extension at point F_0.\n\nGiven this geometric construction, what is the measure of angle B-A-E — formed by segments AB and AE at vertex A — expressed in radians, computed via the vector dot product method (non-standard radian form)?"
