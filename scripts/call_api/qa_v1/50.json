    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle. Points D, E, and F are additional intersection points along the arcs and sides of the triangle, with E lying on segment BC and also on the smaller circle. The angle ∠BAC is formed at vertex A by segments AB and AC.\n\nFind the radian measure of ∠BAC, expressed as a multiple of π, using vector methods or geometric properties of the circumscribed triangle and concentric circles."
