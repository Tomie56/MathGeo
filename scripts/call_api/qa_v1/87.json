    "A regular pentagon with center O1 and side length 5 is given. Two rounds of circum-inscribe operations are performed, resulting in a circumscribed pentagon followed by an inscribed pentagon, both sharing center O1. The final configuration contains 11 labeled points, including vertices A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, and midpoint M_0, with 10 line segments and no arcs. In the first enhancement round, a line is drawn from vertex A to M_0, the midpoint of segment L0 (defined as segment AB). \n\nCalculate the length of segment AM₀."
