    "In the given geometric construction, a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3 is the base figure. A square centered at point E is derived such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon. Point I is a vertex of the square, and point K is another vertex of the square, positioned such that both I and K lie on the circumcircle of the octagon. Point O1 is the center of the octagon and also lies on the line segment connecting H (a vertex of the octagon) and O1, as per the final construction step.\n\nFind the radian measure of angle ∠I-O1-K, formed at vertex O1 by the segments O1I and O1K. Express your answer as an exact multiple of π."
