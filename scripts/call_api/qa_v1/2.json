Translation derivation: 3-sided polygon (new center O2) translated perpendicular to side 1. Found 8 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 2 new lines and 0 new arcs generated by splitting. Total lines: 8, total arcs: 0, total points: 8.\n增强操作总轮数: 0",

    "In the given geometric configuration, two congruent equilateral triangles are positioned such that triangle ABC (centered at O1) is translated perpendicularly along the direction of side BC to form triangle CDE (centered at O2), with point C shared as a vertex. All sides of both triangles have length 1. Points A, B, C, D, E, F, O1, and O2 are labeled as shown, with O1 and O2 being the respective centroids. The translation preserves orientation and results in a symmetric “V”-shaped composite figure.\n\nFind the radian measure of angle ∠BAC, expressed as a multiple of π."
