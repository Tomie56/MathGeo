    "Consider a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3, oriented at 0 radians. A square is inscribed such that its center is at point E and its radius equals that of the octagon. The square shares vertex D with the octagon and extends to include vertices I and K. Let angle I-O1-K be the angle formed at O1 by segments O1I and O1K.\n\nFind the radian measure of angle I-O1-K, expressed as a multiple of π."
