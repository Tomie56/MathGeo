    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle. Points D, E, and F are the points of tangency of the triangle with the smaller circle, where D lies on AB, E on BC, and F on AC. Point M_0 is the midpoint of segment AC (line L7). A line segment is drawn connecting point F to point M_0.\n\nDetermine the length of segment FM₀."
