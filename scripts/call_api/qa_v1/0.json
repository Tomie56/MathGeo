Translation derivation: 3-sided polygon (new center O2) translated perpendicular to side 1. Found 8 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 2 new lines and 0 new arcs generated by splitting. Total lines: 8, total arcs: 0, total points: 8.\n增强操作总轮数: 0",

    "In the given figure, two congruent equilateral triangles are positioned such that one is translated perpendicularly from the other relative to one of its sides. The first triangle, centered at O1, has side length 1 and vertices A, B, and C. The second triangle, centered at O2, is a translation of the first and has vertices C, D, and E, with point F completing the structure as shown. Line segment DC is a side of the second triangle.\n\nDetermine the length of line segment DC."
