Translation derivation: 3-sided polygon (new center O2) translated perpendicular to side 1. Found 8 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 2 new lines and 0 new arcs generated by splitting.

    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O₁ with side length 1 is initially present. After one round of derivation involving a translation perpendicular to one of its sides (producing a second triangle centered at O₂), and following the connection of points D and B (both lying on existing segments), a total of 8 points and 8 line segments are formed. Among these, consider triangle ABC, where points A, B, and C are vertices of the original triangle.\n\nDetermine the radian measure of the angle formed by line segments AB and CA at vertex A. Express your answer as a multiple of π, using the vector dot product method for precision."
