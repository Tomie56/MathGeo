    "In the given geometric construction, two congruent equilateral triangles are positioned such that one is translated perpendicularly relative to a side of the other. The original triangle (centered at O1) has side length 1 and is rotated by π/3 radians. After one round of translation, a second triangle (centered at O2) is formed, resulting in a total of 8 labeled points and 8 line segments. Points M₀ and M₁ are defined as the midpoints of segments L₄ and L₀, respectively. Line segment M₀M₁ is drawn connecting these two midpoints.\n\nCalculate the length of segment M₀M₁."
