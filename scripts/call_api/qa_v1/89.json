    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 5 is initially inscribed. After two rounds of circum-inscribe operations, a larger circumscribed pentagon and a smaller inscribed pentagon are formed, both sharing center O1. The final figure includes 11 labeled points (A–J and M_0) and 10 line segments. In the first enhancement round, vertex A is connected to M_0, the midpoint of segment AB.\n\nGiven this configuration, what is the radian measure of the angle ∠BAE — that is, the angle between line segments AB and EA — at vertex A? (Hint: Use vector dot product methods for precise calculation; the result may not be in standard radian form.)"
