    "In the given diagram, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 has an inscribed triangle ABC, such that points A, B, and C lie on the circle. A perpendicular is drawn from point A to chord BC, meeting it at foot F₀, which lies on segment BC. The angle ∠BAC is formed at vertex A by segments AB and AC. Using vector methods or geometric properties of the circle and inscribed triangle, determine the radian measure of ∠BAC, expressed as a multiple of π."
