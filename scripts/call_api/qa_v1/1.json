    "In the given geometric construction, two congruent equilateral triangles are positioned such that triangle ABC (centered at O1) and triangle CDF (centered at O2) share vertex C. Triangle CDF is obtained by translating triangle ABC perpendicular to side AB by a distance equal to its height. All sides have length 1. Point E lies on segment CF such that CE = 1, and point D is positioned such that CD = 1 and angle DCF = 60°, preserving the equilateral structure.\n\nDetermine the radian measure of the angle formed by line segment AB and line segment CA at vertex A — that is, angle BAC — using vector methods and express the result as a multiple of π."
