Concentric derivation: circle (center O1) scaled by 2 (new radius 10). Round 2: applying 'circum_inscribe' rule. Circumscribed 3-sided polygon (center O1) around circle. Found 8 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 6 new lines and 7 new arcs generated by splitting.

    "In the given diagram, a large circle centered at O1 with radius 10 circumscribes an equilateral triangle ABC. A smaller concentric circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is inscribed within triangle ABC, tangent to its sides at points D, E, and F. Point D lies on side AB, point E on side BC, and point F on side AC. Segment DE is drawn connecting the points of tangency on sides AB and BC. Extend segment DE to intersect the large circle again at point B (noting that B is also a vertex of the triangle). What is the measurement of line segment DB?"
