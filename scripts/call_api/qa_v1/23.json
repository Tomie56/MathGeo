    "In the given geometric construction, a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3 is the base figure. A square centered at point E is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1, with its radius equal to that of the octagon. After one round of derivation, 12 total points are identified, including intersections. Among the 16 resulting line segments, the segment connecting points H and O1 is explicitly constructed in the final step.\n\nWhat is the measurement of Line_H_O1?"
