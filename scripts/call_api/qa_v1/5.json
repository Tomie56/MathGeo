    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 1 is initially drawn. After one round of translation — specifically, translating a congruent triangle (centered at O2) perpendicular to one of its sides — a composite figure is formed with 8 labeled points and 8 line segments. In the first and only enhancement step, a perpendicular is drawn from point B to line L2, intersecting it at foot point F_0, which lies on segment AC. \n\nWhat is the length of segment BF₀?"
