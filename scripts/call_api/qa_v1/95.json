    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 5 is initially inscribed, then successively circumscribed and reinscribed about the same center, resulting in a nested arrangement of polygons. After two derivation rounds using the “circum_inscribe” rule, a total of 11 distinct points (including intersections) are identified, and 10 line segments are drawn, with no arcs. In the final configuration, points J and H — both lying on existing segments — are connected by an additional line segment in a single enhancement step.\n\nConsider the angle ∠BAE formed at vertex A by the line segments AB and EA. Using vector methods (specifically the dot product), determine the radian measure of ∠BAE. Express your answer in non-standard radian form, accurate to the geometric construction described."
