    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O₁ with side length 1 is rotated by π/3 radians. Following one round of translation—specifically, translating a congruent triangle (centered at O₂) perpendicular to its first side—a composite figure is formed with 8 labeled points and 8 line segments. In the first and only enhancement step, the midpoints M₀ (of segment L₄) and M₁ (of segment L₀) are connected, forming an additional line segment that intersects existing segments at points L₃ and L₄.\n\nGiven this configuration, determine the radian measure of the angle ∠BAC formed at vertex A by the lines AB and AC, expressed as a multiple of π. Use vector dot product methods for precise calculation."
