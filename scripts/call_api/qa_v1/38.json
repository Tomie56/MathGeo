    "In the given diagram, a regular hexagon with center O1 and side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scaled by 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. After one derivation round, 13 distinct points are identified, including vertices and intersections. In the first and only enhancement step, vertex I is connected to midpoint M_0 of line segment L3 (assumed to be segment DE based on labeling), forming an additional line segment IM_0. All lines are straight; no arcs are present.\n\nConsidering the outer hexagon’s vertices labeled A through F in clockwise order, and given that point A is a shared vertex of the outer hexagon, what is the radian measure of the angle ∠BAF — that is, the angle formed at vertex A between line segments AB and FA — expressed as a multiple of π?\n\n(Note: The internal geometry and derived segments do not alter the angular structure of the original regular hexagon at vertex A.)"
