Translation derivation: 3-sided polygon (new center O2) translated perpendicular to side 1. Found 8 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 2 new lines and 0 new arcs generated by splitting.

    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 1 is initially positioned. After one round of derivation involving a translation perpendicular to one side (resulting in a second triangle centered at O2), the figure contains 8 total labeled points (A, B, C, D, E, F, O1, O2) and 8 line segments. In the first and only derivation step, segment DB is drawn connecting points D and B, both lying on existing segments. \n\nGiven this configuration, compute the radian measure of angle BAC — the angle formed at vertex A by segments AB and AC — using vector dot product methods. Express your final answer as an exact multiple of π."
