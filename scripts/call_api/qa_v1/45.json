    "A regular hexagon with center O₁ and side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O₁. Points A and C lie on the outer hexagon’s perimeter, specifically on adjacent sides, and are connected by a straight line segment. Determine the length of segment CA."
