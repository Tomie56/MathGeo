    "In the given diagram, triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle centered at O1 with radius 5. Points A, B, and C lie on the circumference, forming chords AB, BC, and AC. The arc BC (denoted Arc_B_C) is the minor arc connecting points B and C along the circle’s circumference.\n\nCalculate the length of arc BC, given that triangle ABC is equilateral and inscribed in the circle."
