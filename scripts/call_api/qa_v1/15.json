    "Two circles of equal radius 5 intersect such that the center of the upper circle, O2, lies on the circumference of the lower circle centered at O1. The circles intersect at points A and B. Consider the arc from point A to point O1 along the lower circle (arc AO1). What is the measurement of arc AO1 in degrees?"
