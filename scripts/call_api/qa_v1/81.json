    "Consider a regular pentagon centered at point O1 with side length 5, rotated by π/5 radians. Two successive “circum_inscribe” operations are applied: first circumscribing a larger pentagon about the original, then inscribing a smaller pentagon within the original, both sharing center O1. The resulting figure contains 11 labeled points (A through J and O1) and 10 line segments, with no arcs or additional splits. Among these, points A, B, and E are vertices of the outer circumscribed pentagon, with A as the common vertex of segments AB and AE.\n\nFind the radian measure of angle ∠BAE — the angle formed at vertex A between vectors AB and AE — using the vector dot product method. Express your answer in exact radian form."
