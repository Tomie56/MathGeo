    "In the given diagram, a regular hexagon with center O1 and side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. Points A, B, C, D, E, F lie on the outer hexagon, and points G, H, I, J, K, L lie on the inner hexagon, with H coinciding with the intersection of segments CA and the inner hexagon’s top side. Point O1 is the common center. In Round 1 of enhancement, segment CA is drawn, connecting vertices C and A of the outer hexagon.\n\nDetermine the radian measure of the angle ∠BAF formed at vertex A by the line segments AB and AF. Express your answer as a multiple of π."
