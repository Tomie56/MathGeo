    "A regular hexagon centered at point O1 with side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. Points A through K, along with O1, are labeled at the vertices and intersections of the two hexagons, totaling 13 distinct points. In the final configuration, a line segment is drawn connecting point F and point D, both lying on the outer hexagon’s sides. \n\nCalculate the length of segment FD."
