    "Consider a regular pentagon centered at point O1 with side length 5, rotated by π/5 radians. Two rounds of “circum_inscribe” operations are applied, yielding a final configuration of 11 labeled points (A through J, and F_0) and 10 line segments, with no arcs. In the first enhancement round, a perpendicular is dropped from point B to line L5 (an extension of segment AE), meeting it at foot point F_0.\n\nGiven this geometric construction, express the angle at vertex A, formed by segments AB and AE, as a radian expression, computed using the vector dot product method (not necessarily in standard simplified form).\n\n**Question:**  \nExpress the angle ∠BAE at point A between vectors AB and AE as a radian expression using the dot product formula."
