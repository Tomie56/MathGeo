    "In the given geometric construction, a regular octagon centered at O1 with side length 3 is the base figure. A derived square centered at E is inscribed such that its vertices lie on the circumcircle of the octagon. Point I is a vertex of the octagon, and point K is a vertex of the derived square, both connected to center O1. Given that all points lie on a common circle centered at O1, and assuming standard positioning (rotation angle 0 radians), determine the radian measure of ∠IO1K — the angle formed at vertex O1 between segments O1I and O1K — expressed as a multiple of π.\n\nWhat is the radian value of the angle between Line_O1_I and Line_K_O1 at vertex O1?"
