Concentric derivation: circle (center O1) scaled by 2 (new radius 10). Round 2: applying 'circum_inscribe' rule. Circumscribed 3-sided polygon (center O1) around circle. Found 8 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 6 new lines and 7 new arcs generated by splitting.

    "In the given geometric construction, a large circle centered at O1 with radius 10 circumscribes an equilateral triangle ABC, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the circle. A smaller concentric circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is also present. Points D, E, and F lie on the smaller circle, with D and F on segments AB and AC respectively, and E on segment BC. A perpendicular is drawn from point B to the extension of line BC (labeled as L3), meeting it at point B itself (i.e., the foot coincides with B). \n\nGiven this configuration, what is the measure of angle BAC (i.e., ∠B-A-C) in radians? Express your answer as a multiple of π."
