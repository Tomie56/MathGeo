    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle ABC is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the larger circle. Points D, E, and F are the points of tangency between the smaller circle and the sides of triangle ABC. Line L3 is defined as line AC. From point B, a perpendicular is dropped to line L3, with the foot of the perpendicular labeled as point B' (not shown explicitly in the image but implied by the operation description).\n\nDetermine the length of the perpendicular segment from point B to line L3 — that is, the length of segment BB'."
