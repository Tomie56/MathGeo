    "In the given diagram, a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3 is shown. A square centered at point E is inscribed such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O1 of the octagon, and its radius equals the circumradius of the octagon. Point E lies on a side of the octagon, and segment O1E connects the center of the octagon to the center of the square. Calculate the length of segment O1E."
