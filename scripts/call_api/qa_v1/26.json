    "Consider a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3, oriented at 0 radians. A square is constructed such that its center is at point E — a vertex of the octagon — and its circumradius equals that of the octagon. Point I is a vertex of the square, and point K is another vertex of the square such that I and K are endpoints of a diagonal passing through E. Line segments O1–I and O1–K are drawn, forming angle ∠I–O1–K at vertex O1.\n\nWhat is the measure of angle I–O1–K in radians? Express your answer as a multiple of π."
