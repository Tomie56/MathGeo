    "A regular pentagon with center O1 and side length 5 is inscribed in a larger regular pentagon, also centered at O1, which is itself circumscribed around the original. This two-step circum-inscribe construction yields a total of 11 labeled points (A through J and O1), with 10 line segments connecting them as shown. Given this configuration, what is the length of segment CD?"
