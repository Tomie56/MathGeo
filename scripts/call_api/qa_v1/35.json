    "In the given diagram, a regular hexagon ABCDEF with center O1 and side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon GHIJKL (scaled by a factor of 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. All vertices are labeled, and no additional lines or arcs are introduced beyond the two hexagons.\n\nWhat is the measure of angle B-A-F, formed by segments AB and AF at vertex A, expressed in radians as a multiple of π?"
