    "In the given geometric construction, a circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is first scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger circle of radius 10. A triangle is then circumscribed about the smaller circle, centered at O1, with vertices lying on the larger circle. Points D and E lie on the sides of this triangle and also on the smaller circle. Line segment DE is drawn connecting these two points.\n\nWhat is the measurement of line segment DE?"
