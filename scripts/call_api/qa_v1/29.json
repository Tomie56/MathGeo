    "In the given geometric construction, a regular octagon centered at O1 with side length 3 is the base figure. A square centered at E, with radius equal to that of the octagon, is derived by placing one of its vertices at the center O1. Point H is a vertex of the octagon, and line L1 is the line passing through points D and F (vertices of the square). A perpendicular is drawn from point H to line L1, intersecting the extension of L1 at foot point F₀.\n\nCalculate the length of segment HF₀."
