    "Consider a regular hexagon centered at point O1 with side length 5, rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. The outer hexagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in counterclockwise order, and the inner hexagon has vertices G, H, I, J, K, L (not all labeled in the image, but implied by structure). In the first and only enhancement round, segment FD is drawn, connecting vertex F of the outer hexagon to vertex D of the outer hexagon, intersecting the inner hexagon at point K.\n\nGiven this configuration, express the angle at vertex A formed by segments AB and FA — that is, angle ∠BAF — as a radian expression in terms of π, using vector dot product methods if necessary."
