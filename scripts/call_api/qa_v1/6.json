    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O₁ with side length 1 is initially present. After one round of transformation — specifically, a translation of a congruent triangle (centered at O₂) perpendicular to one of its sides — a composite figure is formed containing 8 labeled points and 8 line segments. Among these, M₀ is the midpoint of segment L₄, and M₁ is the midpoint of segment L₀. A new segment, Line_M₀_M₁, is drawn connecting these two midpoints.\n\nDetermine the length of Line_M₀_M₁."
