    "In the given diagram, a regular hexagon with center O1 and side length 5 is inscribed, rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scaled by 1/2) is drawn inside it, sharing the same center O1. Points M₀ and M₁ are defined as the midpoints of two adjacent sides of the outer hexagon — specifically, M₀ lies on side AB and M₁ lies on side AF. A line segment M₀M₁ is drawn connecting these two midpoints.\n\nWhat is the measurement of Line M₀M₁?"
