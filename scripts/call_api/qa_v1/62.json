Concentric derivation: circle (center O1) scaled by 2 (new radius 10). Round 2: applying 'circum_inscribe' rule. Circumscribed 3-sided polygon (center O1) around circle. Found 8 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 6 new lines and 7 new arcs generated by splitting.

    "In the given geometric construction, a large circle centered at O1 with radius 10 circumscribes an equilateral triangle ABC, with vertices A, B, and C lying on the circle. A smaller concentric circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is inscribed within triangle ABC, tangent to its sides at points D, E, and F. Line L3 is defined as the line segment AC. From point B, a perpendicular is dropped to line L3, and its foot lies on the extension of L3 beyond point C, denoted as point B'.\n\nCalculate the length of segment BB'."
