Concentric derivation: circle (center O1) scaled by 2 (new radius 10). Round 2: applying 'circum_inscribe' rule. Circumscribed 3-sided polygon (center O1) around circle. Found 8 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 6 new lines and 7 new arcs generated by splitting.

    "In the figure, a large circle centered at O1 with radius 10 circumscribes an equilateral triangle ABC. A smaller concentric circle centered at O1 with radius 5 is inscribed within triangle ABC, tangent to its sides at points D, E, and F. Point D lies on side AB, point E lies on side BC, and point F lies on side AC. Segment DE connects points D and E.\n\nDetermine the length of segment DE."
