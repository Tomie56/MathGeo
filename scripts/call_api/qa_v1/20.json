    "In the given geometric construction, a regular octagon centered at point O1 with side length 3 is the base figure. A square centered at point E is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1, with its circumradius equal to that of the octagon. The resulting figure contains 12 distinct labeled points and 16 line segments. Consider the angle ∠I-O1-K formed at vertex O1 by the line segments O1I and O1K.\n\nWhat is the radian measure of ∠I-O1-K, expressed as a multiple of π?"
