    "In the given diagram, a large circle centered at O1 with radius 10 circumscribes an equilateral triangle ABC. A smaller concentric circle, also centered at O1, has radius 5 and is tangent to the sides of triangle ABC at points D, E, and F. Point D lies on side AB, point E on side BC, and point F on side AC. Line DB is the segment from vertex B to the point of tangency D on side AB.\n\nFind the length of segment DB."
