    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 1 is initially positioned. After one round of derivation involving a perpendicular translation to generate a second congruent triangle centered at O2, a line segment is drawn connecting the midpoint M₀ of segment AB and the midpoint M₁ of segment EC. The resulting figure contains 8 labeled points (A, B, C, D, E, F, M₀, M₁) and 8 line segments, with no arcs. \n\nGiven this configuration, what is the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AC — expressed as a multiple of π?"
