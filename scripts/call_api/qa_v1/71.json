    "In the given diagram, triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle centered at O1 with radius 5. Points A, B, and C lie on the circumference, forming triangle ABC. The angle at vertex A is formed by segments AB and AC. Using vector geometry or properties of inscribed angles, determine the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle between line AB and line CA at vertex A — expressed as a multiple of π."
