    "In the given geometric construction, starting with an equilateral triangle centered at O1 with side length 1, a second equilateral triangle centered at O2 is obtained by translating the first triangle perpendicularly to one of its sides. Point B is a vertex of the first triangle, and line L2 is the side of the second triangle corresponding to the translated side. A perpendicular is drawn from point B to line L2, meeting it at foot point F_0, which lies on the segment of L2.\n\nWhat is the measurement of segment BF₀?"
