    "In the given geometric construction, a regular hexagon centered at O1 with side length 5 is rotated by π/6 radians. A concentric, scaled-down hexagon (scale factor 1/2) is inscribed within it, sharing the same center O1. Point A lies on the outer hexagon, and point F is the adjacent vertex clockwise from A on the outer hexagon. Point B is the next vertex counterclockwise from A on the outer hexagon. Line segment CA is drawn, connecting vertex C (two vertices counterclockwise from A) to A, but this does not affect the angle in question. \n\nFind the radian measure of angle ∠BAF — the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AF — expressed as a multiple of π."
