    "We are given a regular octagon inscribed in a circle centered at **O1**, with side length **10**. Points **I** and **J** lie on the same circle (centered at O1), and triangle **I-J-O2** is constructed such that:\n\n- O2 is the **center** of triangle I-J-O2 (i.e., centroid or circumcenter? We’ll clarify),\n- The side length of triangle I-J-O2 equals that of the octagon → so **IJ = 10**,\n- Points I and J lie on the circle centered at O1 → so **O1I = O1J = R**, the radius of the circle.\n\nWe are to find the **radian measure of angle ∠I-O1-J**, i.e., the central angle subtended by chord IJ at center O1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nSince the octagon is regular and inscribed in a circle centered at O1, all its vertices lie on the circle. The side length of the octagon is 10.\n\nIn a regular octagon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is:\n\n> **θ = 2π / 8 = π/4 radians**\n\nBut points I and J are **not necessarily adjacent vertices** of the octagon — they are points on the circle such that chord IJ has length 10, and triangle I-J-O2 has side length 10 and O2 as its center.\n\nWait — the problem says: “triangle I-J-O2 is constructed such that O2 is its center and its side length equals that of the octagon.”\n\nThis is ambiguous. What does “its center” mean? In a triangle, “center” could mean:\n\n- Centroid (intersection of medians),\n- Circumcenter (center of circumscribed circle),\n- Incenter (center of inscribed circle),\n- Orthocenter.\n\nBut since the triangle is said to have “side length equals that of the octagon”, and IJ = 10, and O2 is “its center”, and the triangle is I-J-O2 — meaning the three vertices are I, J, and O2 — then the side lengths are:\n\n- IJ = 10 (given),\n- IO2 = ?,\n- JO2 = ?\n\nIf O2 is the **circumcenter** of triangle IJO2, that doesn’t make sense — O2 is a vertex.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the triangle is **equilateral** with side length 10, and O2 is its **centroid** or **circumcenter**.\n\nBut if triangle I-J-O2 is equilateral with side length 10, then all sides are 10: IJ = IO2 = JO2 = 10.\n\nAnd O2 is the center — likely meaning the **centroid** or **circumcenter** of the triangle.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, centroid, circumcenter, incenter, orthocenter all coincide.\n\nSo let’s assume:\n\n> Triangle I-J-O2 is **equilateral** with side length 10, and O2 is its center (i.e., centroid/circumcenter).\n\nThen, points I and J lie on the circle centered at O1, and O2 is a point such that triangle IJO2 is equilateral.\n\nWe are to find angle ∠I-O1-J, i.e., the central angle subtended by chord IJ at center O1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use chord length formula\n\nIn a circle of radius R, the length of a chord subtending a central angle θ (in radians) is:\n\n> **chord length = 2R sin(θ/2)**\n\nWe are told that chord IJ has length 10, and it lies on the circle centered at O1, so:\n\n> **10 = 2R sin(θ/2)** → **sin(θ/2) = 5/R**\n\nSo if we can find R, the radius of the circle (which is the circumradius of the regular octagon with side length 10), we can compute θ.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find the circumradius R of a regular octagon with side length 10\n\nFor a regular polygon with n sides of length s, the circumradius R is:\n\n> **R = s / (2 sin(π/n))**\n\nFor octagon, n = 8, s = 10:\n\n> **R = 10 / (2 sin(π/8)) = 5 / sin(π/8)**\n\nWe need sin(π/8). Recall:\n\n> sin(π/8) = sin(22.5°) = √[(1 - cos(45°)) / 2] = √[(1 - √2/2)/2] = √[(2 - √2)/4] = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo:\n\n> R = 5 / [√(2 - √2)/2] = 5 * 2 / √(2 - √2) = 10 / √(2 - √2)\n\nWe can rationalize or leave for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Plug into chord formula\n\nWe have:\n\n> sin(θ/2) = 5 / R = 5 / [10 / √(2 - √2)] = (5 * √(2 - √2)) / 10 = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nBut wait — that’s exactly sin(π/8)!\n\n> sin(θ/2) = √(2 - √2)/2 = sin(π/8)\n\nTherefore:\n\n> θ/2 = π/8 → θ = π/4\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\n\nThe central angle ∠I-O1-J is **π/4 radians**.\n\nBut wait — is this consistent with the triangle I-J-O2?\n\nWe assumed triangle I-J-O2 is equilateral with side 10, and I and J lie on the circle of radius R = 10 / (2 sin(π/8)) ≈ 10 / (2 * 0.3827) ≈ 13.0656.\n\nThen, distance from I to O2 is 10, and O2 is the center of the equilateral triangle.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle of side 10, the distance from a vertex to the centroid is:\n\n> distance = (2/3) * height = (2/3) * (√3/2 * 10) = (10√3)/3 ≈ 5.7735\n\nBut O1 is the center of the circle, and I and J are on the circle, so O1I = O1J = R ≈ 13.0656.\n\nO2 is a point such that IO2 = JO2 = 10, and IJ = 10.\n\nSo triangle IJO2 is equilateral, and O2 is not at O1.\n\nThe angle ∠I-O1-J is determined solely by chord IJ and the circle centered at O1 — and we found that chord IJ = 10 corresponds to central angle π/4, because that’s the same as the side length of the octagon.\n\nIn a regular octagon, each side subtends a central angle of π/4, and has chord length 10.\n\nTherefore, if IJ = 10 and lies on the same circle, then ∠I-O1-J = π/4.\n\nThis is consistent.\n\nThe triangle I-J-O2 being equilateral with side 10 is just additional information — perhaps to confirm that such points I and J exist on the circle (since in a circle of radius R ≈ 13.0656, a chord of length 10 is possible, and we can construct an equilateral triangle on it with third vertex O2 inside the circle).\n\nBut the angle ∠I-O1-J depends only on the chord length and the circle’s radius — which we computed, and it gives θ = π/4.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n$$"
