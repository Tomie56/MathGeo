    "We are given a geometric construction involving two concentric equilateral triangles:\n\n- An **inner regular triangle** (equilateral) with side length 6 and center O1.\n- It is **scaled concentrically by a factor of 2** to form a **larger outer triangle**.\n- L2 is a side of the inner triangle, L3 is the corresponding side of the outer triangle.\n- M1 is the **midpoint of L2**, M0 is the **midpoint of L3**.\n- We are to find the length of segment **M0M1**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the scaling\n\nSince the outer triangle is a **concentric scaling** of the inner triangle by factor 2, every point on the outer triangle is twice as far from the center O1 as the corresponding point on the inner triangle.\n\nThis includes the **midpoints** of corresponding sides.\n\nSo, if M1 is the midpoint of a side of the inner triangle, then M0 — the midpoint of the corresponding side of the outer triangle — lies on the same ray from O1, and at **twice the distance** from O1 as M1.\n\nTherefore, the vector from O1 to M0 is twice the vector from O1 to M1.\n\nThus, the distance between M0 and M1 is:\n\n> |M0M1| = |O1M0 - O1M1| = |2·O1M1 - O1M1| = |O1M1|\n\nWait — that would imply |M0M1| = |O1M1|, but that’s only if they are colinear and M0 is further out — which they are.\n\nActually, since M0 lies on the same ray from O1 as M1, and |O1M0| = 2·|O1M1|, then the distance between M0 and M1 is:\n\n> |M0M1| = |O1M0| - |O1M1| = 2·|O1M1| - |O1M1| = |O1M1|\n\nSo we need to compute the distance from the center O1 to the midpoint of a side of the inner equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find distance from center O1 to midpoint of a side (i.e., |O1M1|)\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle**, the center (centroid, circumcenter, incenter, orthocenter — all coincide) is located at a distance from each side equal to the **inradius**.\n\nBut here, we want the distance from the center to the **midpoint of a side** — which is exactly the **inradius**.\n\nWait — actually, in an equilateral triangle, the distance from the center to a **vertex** is the **circumradius R**, and to the **midpoint of a side** is the **inradius r**.\n\nWe can compute both.\n\nGiven side length **s = 6**.\n\n#### Formula for inradius (r) of equilateral triangle:\n\n> r = (s √3) / 6\n\n#### Formula for circumradius (R):\n\n> R = (s √3) / 3\n\nSo:\n\n> r = (6 √3) / 6 = √3  \n> R = (6 √3) / 3 = 2√3\n\nSo, the distance from center O1 to the midpoint of a side (M1) is **r = √3**.\n\nTherefore, since M0 is on the same ray and at twice the distance from O1, we have:\n\n> |O1M0| = 2 * |O1M1| = 2√3\n\nThen, since M0 and M1 are colinear with O1, and M0 is further out:\n\n> |M0M1| = |O1M0| - |O1M1| = 2√3 - √3 = √3\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Verification:\n\nAlternatively, think in coordinates.\n\nPlace the inner equilateral triangle with center at origin O1 = (0,0).\n\nOne standard placement: place one vertex at (0, R) = (0, 2√3), and the base horizontal.\n\nBut easier: place the triangle with centroid at origin.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the centroid divides the median in 2:1 ratio.\n\nLet’s place the triangle with base on x-axis.\n\nLet’s define the inner triangle with vertices:\n\nLet’s place vertex A at (0, h), and base BC from (-3, 0) to (3, 0), so side length = 6.\n\nHeight of equilateral triangle = (√3 / 2) * side = (√3 / 2)*6 = 3√3.\n\nSo vertex A is at (0, 3√3), base from (-3,0) to (3,0).\n\nCentroid O1 is at average of vertices:\n\n> x = (0 + (-3) + 3)/3 = 0  \n> y = (3√3 + 0 + 0)/3 = √3\n\nSo O1 is at (0, √3)\n\nMidpoint of base BC is M1 = (0,0)\n\nWait — that’s interesting.\n\nSo in this coordinate system:\n\n- O1 = (0, √3)\n- M1 = midpoint of BC = (0,0)\n- So |O1M1| = distance = √[(0-0)^2 + (√3 - 0)^2] = √3 — matches!\n\nNow, the outer triangle is scaled by 2 **concentrically** about O1 = (0, √3).\n\nSo, to get the outer triangle, we scale each point by factor 2 from O1.\n\nSo, to get M0 (midpoint of corresponding side in outer triangle), we scale M1 = (0,0) from O1 = (0, √3) by factor 2.\n\nVector from O1 to M1: (0 - 0, 0 - √3) = (0, -√3)\n\nScale by 2: (0, -2√3)\n\nAdd to O1: (0, √3) + (0, -2√3) = (0, -√3)\n\nSo M0 = (0, -√3)\n\nM1 = (0,0)\n\nThen distance M0M1 = |0 - (-√3)| = √3\n\n✅ Confirmed.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$"
