    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 6 is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2, resulting in an outer triangle DEF and an inner triangle ABC, both sharing center O1. Point M0 is the midpoint of segment DE, and point M1 is the midpoint of segment AC. Segment M0M1 is drawn, intersecting AB at point I3. Given this configuration, find the radian measure of angle BAC — that is, the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AC."

    "We are told that there is a **regular triangle** (i.e., an **equilateral triangle**) centered at point **O1**, with side length **6**. This triangle is scaled **concentrically** by a factor of **2**, resulting in an **outer triangle DEF** and an **inner triangle ABC**, both sharing center **O1**.\n\nWe are to find the **radian measure of angle BAC** — that is, the angle at vertex **A** between segments **AB** and **AC**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the nature of triangle ABC\n\nSince the original triangle is **regular** (equilateral), and it is scaled concentrically, the resulting inner triangle **ABC** is also **equilateral**.\n\n> **Key fact**: All angles in an equilateral triangle are equal to **60 degrees**, or **π/3 radians**.\n\nTherefore, angle **BAC**, being an internal angle of equilateral triangle **ABC**, must be:\n\n> **∠BAC = π/3 radians**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Verify that the construction does not alter the angle\n\nThe problem introduces additional points:\n\n- **M0**: midpoint of **DE** (side of outer triangle)\n- **M1**: midpoint of **AC** (side of inner triangle)\n- **I3**: intersection of **M0M1** with **AB**\n\nHowever, **none of these constructions affect the shape or angles of triangle ABC**. Triangle ABC remains equilateral, regardless of the outer triangle or the lines drawn between midpoints.\n\nThe angle **BAC** is purely a property of triangle **ABC**, which is equilateral by construction.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nThus, the radian measure of angle **BAC** is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
