    "We are given two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, each with side length 7. Square EFGH is translated perpendicularly from square ABCD along the direction of side CD (or GH), and they share vertex C with vertex H. We are to find the measure of angle BAD in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry of square ABCD\n\nIn any square, all interior angles are right angles — that is, 90 degrees.\n\nAngle BAD is the angle at vertex A between sides BA and DA.\n\nIn square ABCD:\n\n- Vertex A is connected to B and D.\n- Since ABCD is a square, angle at A (angle BAD) is formed by two adjacent sides, which are perpendicular.\n\nTherefore, **angle BAD = 90 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Convert degrees to radians\n\nWe know:\n\n\\[\n\\pi \\text{ radians} = 180^\\circ\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider whether other information affects this\n\nThe problem gives additional information:\n\n- Square EFGH is congruent and translated perpendicularly along CD, sharing vertex C with H.\n- O1 and O2 are centers.\n- M0 is midpoint of AB.\n- A line is drawn from H to M0.\n\nHowever, **none of this affects angle BAD**, which is an internal angle of square ABCD. Since ABCD is a square, angle BAD is always 90 degrees regardless of the position or orientation of other squares or points.\n\nThe extra information may be a red herring or intended for a different part of a multi-part problem, but for **this specific question**, it is irrelevant.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n\\]"
