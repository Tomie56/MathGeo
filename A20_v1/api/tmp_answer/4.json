    "We are given that triangle $ABC$ is **equilateral** and **inscribed in a circle** centered at $O_1$. All three vertices lie on the circle, so it is a **circumscribed circle** (circumcircle) of the equilateral triangle.\n\nWe are to find the **measure of arc $CA$** in **degrees**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle\n\nIn an equilateral triangle:\n\n- All sides are equal: $AB = BC = CA = 7$ (given).\n- All interior angles are $60^\\circ$.\n- Since it is inscribed in a circle, the circle is the **circumcircle** of the triangle.\n- The central angles subtended by each side are equal, because the triangle is equilateral and symmetric.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the relationship between central angles and arcs\n\nIn a circle, the **measure of an arc** (in degrees) is equal to the **measure of the central angle** that subtends it.\n\nSo, arc $CA$ is subtended by the central angle $\\angle CO_1A$.\n\nSince triangle $ABC$ is equilateral and inscribed in the circle, the three arcs $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ are **equal** in measure.\n\nThe entire circle is $360^\\circ$, so each arc must measure:\n\n$$\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{3} = 120^\\circ\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm with central angle\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the central angles.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, the center $O_1$ is also the **centroid**, **circumcenter**, **incenter**, and **orthocenter** (due to symmetry).\n\nThe central angle corresponding to each side is twice the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.\n\nBut since we are dealing with central angles directly, and the triangle is equilateral, the three central angles $\\angle AO_1B$, $\\angle BO_1C$, and $\\angle CO_1A$ are all equal and sum to $360^\\circ$.\n\nThus, each is $120^\\circ$, so arc $CA$ (which is subtended by $\\angle CO_1A$) is $120^\\circ$.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{120^\\circ}\n$$"
