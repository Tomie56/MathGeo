    "Two circles, centered at O₁ and O₂ respectively, intersect at points A and C. A third point B lies on the circumference of the circle centered at O₁ such that triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O₁. Given that triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 9, and that circle O₂ is a translation of circle O₁ to the right (sharing the same radius), determine the circumference of circle O₁."

    "We are given:\n\n- Two circles centered at O₁ and O₂, intersecting at points A and C.\n- Point B lies on the circumference of circle O₁.\n- Triangle ABC is **equilateral** with side length 9.\n- Triangle ABC is **inscribed** in circle O₁ → so circle O₁ is the **circumcircle** of triangle ABC.\n- Circle O₂ is a **translation** of circle O₁ to the right, and shares the **same radius**.\n\nWe are to find the **circumference** of circle O₁.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral and inscribed in circle O₁, circle O₁ is the **circumcircle** of equilateral triangle ABC.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the **circumradius** R is related to the side length s by the formula:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nWait — let’s double-check that.\n\nActually, the correct formula for the circumradius R of an equilateral triangle with side length s is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\quad \\text{?}\n\\]\n\nNo — let’s derive it properly.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Derive the circumradius of an equilateral triangle\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the centroid, circumcenter, orthocenter, and incenter all coincide.\n\nThe height h of an equilateral triangle with side s is:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s\n\\]\n\nThe circumcenter lies at 2/3 of the height from any vertex.\n\nSo the circumradius R is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot h = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} s = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nWait — actually, \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), so yes:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nBut let’s rationalize it:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\nYes — this is the standard formula.\n\n✅ So for an equilateral triangle of side length s, the circumradius is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Plug in s = 9\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{9 \\sqrt{3}}{3} = 3 \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute the circumference of circle O₁\n\nCircumference = \\(2\\pi R\\)\n\n\\[\nC = 2\\pi \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 6\\pi\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nThe problem asks for the **circumference** of circle O₁, which we have computed as \\(6\\pi\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nNote: The information about circle O₂ being a translation of O₁ to the right and intersecting at A and C is **not needed** to compute the circumference of circle O₁, because we are told triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O₁ and is equilateral with side 9 — so we can directly compute the circumradius and hence the circumference.\n\nThe fact that O₂ is a translation and shares the same radius is likely a red herring or for context, but does not affect the calculation of the circumference of O₁.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{6\\pi\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]"
