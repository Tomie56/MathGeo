    "In the given figure, a regular octagon centered at O1 with side length 10 is inscribed in a circle. A triangle centered at O2, with side length equal to that of the octagon, is constructed such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O1. From vertex A of the octagon, a perpendicular is drawn to line L6 (an extension of a side or diagonal of the derived triangle), with foot at point F0. Determine the length of segment AF0."
