    "In the given diagram, triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle centered at O1, with AB, BC, and CA as chords. Point F0 lies on segment BC such that AF0 is perpendicular to BC. Given that triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 7 and centered at O1, and that AF0 is the altitude from A to BC, what is the measure of angle BAC in radians?"

    "We are given that triangle $ABC$ is **equilateral** with side length 7, inscribed in a circle centered at $O_1$, and that $AF_0$ is the **altitude** from $A$ to side $BC$, with $F_0$ lying on $BC$.\n\nWe are asked to find the **measure of angle $BAC$ in radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle**, all three sides are equal, and all three interior angles are equal.\n\nSince the sum of interior angles in any triangle is $\\pi$ radians (or $180^\\circ$), each angle in an equilateral triangle is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\nTherefore, angle $BAC = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm with given information\n\nThe problem states:\n\n- Triangle $ABC$ is equilateral → all angles are equal → each is $\\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians.\n- $AF_0$ is the altitude from $A$ to $BC$ → this is consistent with equilateral triangle properties (altitude, median, angle bisector coincide).\n- The circle is centered at $O_1$ → this is the circumcenter, which in an equilateral triangle coincides with the centroid and orthocenter. But this does not affect the angle measure.\n\nSo, **no further calculation is needed** — the angle $BAC$ is simply the interior angle of an equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
