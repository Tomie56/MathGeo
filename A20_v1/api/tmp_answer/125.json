    "We are given a regular octagon centered at O1, inscribed in a circle centered at O1, with side length 10. Points I and J lie on the perimeter of the octagon. A triangle I-J-O2 is constructed such that O2 is its center (likely centroid or circumcenter — we’ll clarify), and its side length equals that of the octagon (i.e., 10). We are to find the angle ∠I-O1-J in radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the regular octagon\n\nA regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal central angles. Since it is inscribed in a circle centered at O1, each vertex lies on the circle, and the central angle between adjacent vertices is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nSo, the angular separation between any two adjacent vertices (as seen from O1) is π/4 radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Locate points I and J\n\nWe are told that triangle I-J-O2 has side length equal to that of the octagon (i.e., 10), and O2 is its center. Also, I and J lie on the octagon’s perimeter.\n\nSince the side length of triangle I-J-O2 is 10, and I and J are on the octagon, the chord IJ must be of length 10 — the same as the side length of the octagon.\n\nIn a regular octagon, the chord length between two vertices separated by **one side** (i.e., adjacent vertices) is exactly the side length of the octagon.\n\nTherefore, **I and J must be adjacent vertices** of the octagon.\n\nWhy? Because if they were separated by more than one side, the chord length would be longer than 10. For example:\n\n- In a regular octagon with side length s, the chord spanning k sides has length:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Chord length} = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{8}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere R is the circumradius.\n\nBut since the side length is 10, and for k=1:\n\n\\[\n10 = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right) \\Rightarrow R = \\frac{10}{2 \\sin(\\pi/8)} = \\frac{5}{\\sin(\\pi/8)}\n\\]\n\nThen for k=2 (two sides apart), chord length = 2R sin(2π/8) = 2R sin(π/4) = 2R * √2/2 = R√2\n\nSubstitute R:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Chord length} = \\frac{5}{\\sin(\\pi/8)} \\cdot \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nWe know sin(π/8) = sin(22.5°) ≈ 0.3827, so:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Chord length} ≈ \\frac{5}{0.3827} \\cdot 1.4142 ≈ 13.06 \\cdot 1.4142 ≈ 18.47 > 10\n\\]\n\nSo only when k=1 (adjacent vertices) is the chord length equal to 10.\n\nThus, **I and J are adjacent vertices** of the octagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find angle ∠I-O1-J\n\nSince I and J are adjacent vertices of the regular octagon centered at O1, the angle ∠I-O1-J is simply the central angle between two adjacent vertices.\n\nAs established in Step 1:\n\n\\[\n\\angle I-O1-J = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Address the triangle I-J-O2 and O2\n\nThe problem mentions triangle I-J-O2 with side length 10 and O2 as its center. Since IJ = 10, and the triangle has side length 10, it must be equilateral. So triangle IJO2 is equilateral with side length 10.\n\nO2 is the center — likely the centroid or circumcenter. In an equilateral triangle, centroid, circumcenter, incenter, etc., all coincide.\n\nBut this information is **not needed** to find ∠I-O1-J, because we already deduced from the chord length that I and J are adjacent vertices, and thus the angle at O1 is π/4.\n\nThe mention of O2 and the triangle may be a red herring or to provide context, but it doesn’t affect the angle ∠I-O1-J, which depends only on the positions of I and J on the octagon and the center O1.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n\\]"
