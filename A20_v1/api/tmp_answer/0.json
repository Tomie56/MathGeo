    "Two circles intersect, with centers labeled O1 and O2. The upper circle is centered at O1 and the lower circle at O2. The circles intersect at two points labeled A and B. Point B lies on the arc of the upper circle (centered at O1) between the two intersection points. Given that the radius of each circle is 8 units, and assuming the line segment O1O2 is vertical and the distance between O1 and O2 is equal to the radius (8 units), what is the measurement of arc O1B — that is, the arc from point O1’s perspective along the upper circle from the topmost point of the circle to point B?\n\n(Note: The arc O1B refers to the arc on the upper circle starting from the point directly above O1 and ending at point B, traversing clockwise or counterclockwise along the circle’s circumference, depending on the diagram’s orientation. Since the diagram shows point B as the left intersection point, and assuming standard positioning, arc O1B is the minor arc from the top of circle O1 to point B.)\n\nWhat is the measurement of Arc_O1_B?"

    "We are given:\n\n- Two circles, both with radius **8 units**.\n- Centers: **O1** (upper circle), **O2** (lower circle).\n- Distance between centers: **O1O2 = 8 units** (equal to the radius).\n- The circles intersect at points **A** and **B**.\n- Point **B** is the **left** intersection point (as per diagram description).\n- We are to find the **measure of arc O1B** — meaning, the arc **on the upper circle (centered at O1)** from the **topmost point** of that circle to point **B**, along the circle’s circumference.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the Geometry\n\nWe have two circles of equal radius (8), with centers 8 units apart. So triangle **O1O2A** and **O1O2B** are both **equilateral triangles**, because:\n\n- O1A = O1O2 = O2A = 8 (since A is on both circles, and O1O2 = 8).\n- Similarly, O1B = O1O2 = O2B = 8.\n\nThus, triangle **O1O2B** is equilateral → all angles are **60°**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Determine the Angle at O1 for Arc O1B\n\nWe are to find the arc from the **topmost point** of circle O1 to point **B**.\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- The **topmost point** of circle O1 is the point directly above O1 — call it **T**.\n- We want the arc **T → B** along the circumference of circle O1.\n\nTo find the measure of arc **TB**, we need the **central angle ∠TO1B**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Set Up Coordinates for Clarity\n\nLet’s place the figure on a coordinate plane to compute angles.\n\n- Place **O1** at (0, 0).\n- Since O1O2 is vertical and 8 units long, and O2 is below O1, place **O2** at (0, -8).\n\nNow, find coordinates of point **B**, the **left** intersection point of the two circles.\n\n### Equation of circle O1 (center (0,0), radius 8):\n\n> x² + y² = 64\n\n### Equation of circle O2 (center (0,-8), radius 8):\n\n> x² + (y + 8)² = 64\n\nSubtract the two equations to find intersection points:\n\n> [x² + (y + 8)²] - [x² + y²] = 0  \n> → (y + 8)² - y² = 0  \n> → y² + 16y + 64 - y² = 0  \n> → 16y + 64 = 0  \n> → y = -4\n\nNow plug y = -4 into circle O1’s equation:\n\n> x² + (-4)² = 64  \n> → x² + 16 = 64  \n> → x² = 48  \n> → x = ±√48 = ±4√3\n\nSo the two intersection points are:\n\n- **A**: (4√3, -4) — right intersection\n- **B**: (-4√3, -4) — left intersection\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Find the Central Angle ∠TO1B\n\nPoint **T** is the topmost point of circle O1 → since O1 is at (0,0), T is at (0, 8).\n\nPoint **B** is at (-4√3, -4)\n\nWe need the angle between vectors **O1T** and **O1B**.\n\nVectors:\n\n- **O1T** = T - O1 = (0, 8) - (0, 0) = (0, 8)\n- **O1B** = B - O1 = (-4√3, -4) - (0, 0) = (-4√3, -4)\n\nWe can use the **dot product formula** to find the angle θ between them:\n\n> **u · v = |u||v| cosθ**\n\nCompute:\n\n- u = (0, 8), v = (-4√3, -4)\n- u · v = (0)(-4√3) + (8)(-4) = -32\n- |u| = √(0² + 8²) = 8\n- |v| = √[(-4√3)² + (-4)²] = √[48 + 16] = √64 = 8\n\nSo:\n\n> -32 = (8)(8) cosθ  \n> → -32 = 64 cosθ  \n> → cosθ = -32/64 = -0.5  \n> → θ = arccos(-0.5) = **120°**\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Interpret the Arc\n\nThe central angle ∠TO1B is **120°**.\n\nSince we are measuring the arc from **T to B** along the circle, and the angle is 120°, the arc measure is **120°**.\n\nBut we must confirm the **direction**. The problem says:\n\n> “arc from the topmost point of the circle to point B, traversing clockwise or counterclockwise... Since the diagram shows point B as the left intersection point... arc O1B is the minor arc from the top of circle O1 to point B.”\n\nWait — 120° is **not** the minor arc if we go the other way. The minor arc would be 360° - 120° = 240°? No — **minor arc is the smaller one**.\n\nActually, 120° is **less than 180°**, so it **is** the minor arc.\n\nBut let’s double-check the path.\n\nFrom T (0,8) to B (-4√3, -4):\n\n- Going **clockwise** from T: down the left side → passes through B → that’s 120°.\n- Going **counterclockwise**: goes right, down, left → 240°.\n\nSince the problem says “arc O1B” and B is the **left** intersection point, and assuming standard orientation, the arc from top to left point **along the shorter path** is **120°**.\n\nAlso, in the equilateral triangle O1O2B, angle at O1 is 60°, but that’s between O1O2 and O1B.\n\nWait — let’s reconcile this.\n\nEarlier we said triangle O1O2B is equilateral → angle ∠O1O2B = 60°, but we need angle between O1T and O1B.\n\nWe already computed it via coordinates and got 120° — that’s correct.\n\nAlternatively, we can think geometrically:\n\n- Vector O1O2 is straight down: from (0,0) to (0,-8) → direction 270° (or -90° from positive x-axis).\n- Vector O1B is to (-4√3, -4) → which is in the third quadrant.\n\nThe angle between O1T (straight up, 90°) and O1B (which has direction arctan(y/x) = arctan(-4 / -4√3) = arctan(1/√3) = 30° below negative x-axis → so 180° + 30° = 210° from positive x-axis).\n\nSo angle from T (90°) to B (210°) is 210° - 90° = 120° — same as before.\n\n✅ So arc measure is **120 degrees**.\n\n---\n\n## Final Answer:\n\nThe measure of arc O1B is **120 degrees**.\n\n$$\n\\boxed{120^\\circ}\n$$"
