    "In the given geometric construction, starting from a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8, a second inscribed regular pentagon is derived (also centered at O1), followed by a vertex-on-center derivation yielding a triangle centered at O2 with side length equal to that of the base pentagon. After one operational round involving drawing a perpendicular from point I to line L5 (with foot at F0), the figure contains 14 labeled points and 13 line segments.

    "We are given a complex geometric construction involving regular pentagons and derived figures, and we are to find the angle ∠KO₁L in radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the construction\n\nWe are told:\n\n- Start with a **regular pentagon centered at O₁**, side length = 8.\n- A **second inscribed regular pentagon** is derived (also centered at O₁). This likely means it’s rotated and scaled inward, sharing the same center.\n- Then, a **vertex-on-center derivation** yields a **triangle centered at O₂**, with side length equal to that of the base pentagon (i.e., 8). This is ambiguous, but likely refers to an equilateral triangle whose vertices lie on the circumcircle of the pentagon or something similar.\n- After one operational round involving drawing a perpendicular from point I to line L5 (foot at F₀), the figure contains 14 labeled points and 13 line segments.\n- We are to find ∠KO₁L — the angle at O₁ between segments O₁K and LO₁.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the diagram\n\nFrom the diagram:\n\n- Points are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, F₀, O₁, O₂.\n- O₁ is the center of the pentagons.\n- O₂ is another center, likely of the triangle.\n- Points K and L are vertices of the outer pentagon (or derived figures).\n- The angle ∠KO₁L is the angle at O₁ between points K, O₁, L.\n\nIn a **regular pentagon**, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is:\n\n> **Central angle = 2π / 5 radians = 72°**\n\nBut we need to know **how many steps apart K and L are** around the pentagon centered at O₁.\n\nLooking at the diagram:\n\n- The outer pentagon appears to have vertices: A, B, C, D, E (in order, clockwise or counterclockwise).\n- Point K is connected to D and L.\n- Point L is connected to E and O₁.\n- Point K is connected to O₁.\n- So likely, K and L are **non-adjacent vertices** of the pentagon.\n\nLet’s assume the pentagon vertices are labeled in order: A, B, C, D, E, going clockwise.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n\n- Point D is connected to K and C.\n- Point E is connected to L and A.\n- So K is likely the next vertex after D? But D is already a vertex.\n\nWait — perhaps K and L are **not** vertices of the outer pentagon, but derived points.\n\nBut the problem says: “a vertex-on-center derivation yielding a triangle centered at O₂ with side length equal to that of the base pentagon.”\n\nThis is vague. However, the key is that we are to find ∠KO₁L — the angle at O₁ between segments O₁K and O₁L.\n\nIn the diagram, we can visually estimate the angle, but we need an exact value.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use symmetry of the regular pentagon\n\nIn a regular pentagon centered at O₁, the angular separation between any two vertices is a multiple of 72° (or 2π/5 radians).\n\nSuppose K and L are two vertices of the pentagon separated by **two edges** (i.e., skipping one vertex). Then the central angle between them is:\n\n> 2 × 72° = 144° = **4π/5 radians**\n\nIf they are separated by **one edge**, it’s 72° = 2π/5.\n\nIf they are opposite (in a pentagon, no true opposite, but maximum separation is 2 steps), then 144°.\n\nLooking at the diagram:\n\n- Points K and L are on opposite sides of O₁.\n- The segment KL passes near O₂, which is offset from O₁.\n- The angle ∠KO₁L appears to be **obtuse**, likely 144°.\n\nMoreover, in a regular pentagon, the angle between two vertices separated by two sides is 144°, which is the internal angle of the pentagon, but here it’s the central angle.\n\nWait — correction:\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the **central angle** between two adjacent vertices is 72°.\n\nBetween vertices with one vertex in between (i.e., two steps apart), the central angle is 144°.\n\nBetween vertices with two in between (i.e., three steps apart), it’s 216°, but that’s the reflex angle; the smaller angle is 144° again (since 360° - 216° = 144°).\n\nSo the possible central angles between any two distinct vertices are 72°, 144°, or their reflex counterparts.\n\nIn the diagram, ∠KO₁L looks like the larger angle — 144°.\n\nBut let’s confirm with the labels.\n\nAssume the outer pentagon has vertices: A, B, C, D, E in clockwise order.\n\nFrom the diagram:\n\n- Point A is connected to B and E.\n- Point B to A and C.\n- Point C to B and D.\n- Point D to C and K.\n- Point E to A and L.\n\nSo K is connected to D, and L to E.\n\nIf K is a vertex adjacent to D, and L adjacent to E, then K and L are likely the next vertices after D and E, but since it’s a pentagon, after E comes A.\n\nWait — perhaps K and L are **not** vertices of the pentagon, but points derived from the construction.\n\nBut the problem says: “the figure contains 14 labeled points and 13 line segments” after the operations.\n\nWe are to find ∠KO₁L.\n\nPerhaps K and L are symmetric with respect to the vertical axis through O₁.\n\nIn that case, if the pentagon is oriented with a vertex at the top, then K and L might be symmetric left and right, making ∠KO₁L = 144°.\n\nAlternatively, if we consider the regular pentagon’s symmetry, and if K and L are two vertices separated by two edges, then the angle is 144°.\n\nMoreover, in many such problems, the angle between two non-adjacent vertices in a regular pentagon is 144°.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm with geometry\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the central angles are multiples of 72°.\n\nThe angle ∠KO₁L is the angle at the center between points K and L.\n\nIf K and L are two vertices of the pentagon, and they are separated by two sides (i.e., there is one vertex between them along the shorter arc), then the central angle is 2 × 72° = 144°.\n\nIf they are separated by one side, it’s 72°.\n\nFrom the diagram, K and L are not adjacent; there is at least one vertex between them.\n\nMoreover, the segment KL is drawn, and it passes near O₂, which is likely the center of the derived triangle.\n\nIn a regular pentagon, if you connect every second vertex, you get a pentagram, and the central angles are 144°.\n\nTherefore, it is highly likely that ∠KO₁L = 144°.\n\nConvert to radians:\n\n> 144° = 144 × π / 180 = (144/180)π = (4/5)π radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\nThus, the angle ∠KO₁L is **4π/5 radians**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{4\\pi}{5}}"
