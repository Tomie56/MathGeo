    "We are given a **regular octagon** centered at point $ O_1 $, with vertices labeled $ A $ through $ H $ in **counterclockwise** order, and side length 3. We are to find the measure of angle $ \\angle BAH $ — that is, the **interior angle at vertex A** formed by segments $ AB $ and $ AH $ — expressed in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular octagon\n\nA **regular octagon** has:\n\n- 8 equal sides\n- 8 equal interior angles\n- All vertices lie on a circle (it is cyclic)\n- The central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $ radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the angle in question\n\nWe are to find $ \\angle BAH $, the angle at vertex $ A $ between points $ B $, $ A $, and $ H $.\n\nIn the labeling order (counterclockwise):  \n$ A \\to B \\to C \\to D \\to E \\to F \\to G \\to H \\to A $\n\nSo, the neighbors of vertex $ A $ are:\n\n- $ B $: next vertex counterclockwise\n- $ H $: previous vertex (clockwise)\n\nTherefore, $ \\angle BAH $ is the **interior angle at vertex A** of the octagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Formula for interior angle of a regular polygon\n\nFor a regular polygon with $ n $ sides, the measure of each **interior angle** is:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{n} \\quad \\text{(in radians)}\n$$\n\nFor an octagon, $ n = 8 $:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(8 - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{8} = \\frac{6\\pi}{8} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm this is the angle $ \\angle BAH $\n\nIn a regular polygon, the interior angle at a vertex is formed by the two adjacent sides meeting at that vertex. At vertex $ A $, the two adjacent sides are $ AB $ and $ AH $, so yes — $ \\angle BAH $ is exactly the interior angle at vertex $ A $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}\n$$\n\nThis is the measure of angle $ \\angle BAH $ in radians."
