    "We are given two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, each with side length 7. Square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD **perpendicular to side DA** such that point H (from the new square) coincides with point C (from the original square).\n\nWe are asked to find the **angle at point A between line segments AB and DA**, expressed in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry of square ABCD\n\nIn any square, all interior angles are **right angles**, i.e., 90 degrees or **π/2 radians**.\n\nThe angle at vertex A of square ABCD is formed by sides AB and AD (or DA — direction doesn’t matter for angle measure).\n\nSo, the angle between AB and DA at point A is simply the interior angle of the square at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm the configuration doesn’t change this angle\n\nThe problem mentions a second square EFGH, obtained by translating ABCD perpendicular to DA, such that H coincides with C.\n\nThis translation moves the entire square ABCD in a direction perpendicular to DA. Since translation is a rigid motion, it preserves all angles and distances. However, the question is **not** asking about any angle involving the second square — it is specifically asking:\n\n> “Express the angle at point A between line segments AB and DA as a radian expression.”\n\nThis is purely about the original square ABCD — the second square is a red herring for this particular question, unless it somehow alters the configuration of ABCD, which it does not. The square ABCD remains unchanged; only a copy (EFGH) is moved.\n\nTherefore, the angle at A between AB and DA is still the interior angle of the square.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Convert 90 degrees to radians\n\nWe know:\n\n\\[\n90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n\\]"
