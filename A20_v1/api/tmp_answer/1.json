    "We are given that triangle $ABC$ is **equilateral** and **inscribed in a circle** centered at $O_1$. All three vertices lie on the circle, and the side length of the triangle is 7. We are to find the **measure of arc $BC$**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle\n\nIn an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle:\n\n- All sides are equal: $AB = BC = CA = 7$.\n- All internal angles are $60^\\circ$.\n- The circle is the **circumcircle** of the triangle.\n- The central angles subtended by each side are equal, because the triangle is equilateral and symmetric.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Relate central angles to arcs\n\nIn a circle, the **measure of an arc** (in degrees) is equal to the **measure of the central angle** that subtends it.\n\nSo, arc $BC$ is subtended by central angle $\\angle BO_1C$.\n\nSince triangle $ABC$ is equilateral and inscribed in the circle, the circle is divided into **three equal arcs** by the three vertices: arc $AB$, arc $BC$, and arc $CA$.\n\nThe total degrees in a circle is $360^\\circ$, so each arc measures:\n\n$$\n\\frac{360^\\circ}{3} = 120^\\circ\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm with central angle\n\nAlternatively, we can think about the central angles.\n\nIn any triangle inscribed in a circle, the central angle subtended by a side is **twice** the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.\n\nIn triangle $ABC$, angle at vertex $A$ is $60^\\circ$, and it subtends arc $BC$. So the central angle $\\angle BO_1C$ is:\n\n$$\n2 \\times 60^\\circ = 120^\\circ\n$$\n\nThus, arc $BC$ measures $120^\\circ$.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{120^\\circ}\n$$"
