    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle with side length 9 and center O1 is inscribed in a circle centered at O1. A second circle, centered at O2, is obtained by translating the first circle horizontally to the right. The two circles intersect at points A and C. Point B is a vertex of the original triangle lying on the first circle. A perpendicular is drawn from point B to the line segment connecting the centers O1 and O2, meeting it at point F0.\n\nWhat is the length of segment BF₀?"
