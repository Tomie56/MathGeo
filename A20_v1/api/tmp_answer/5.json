    "We are given that triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in a circle centered at $O_1$, and that all sides are equal: $AB = BC = CA = 7$. This means triangle $ABC$ is **equilateral**.\n\nWe are also told that:\n- $M_0$ is the midpoint of side $AB$,\n- $M_1$ is the midpoint of side $AC$,\n- We are to find the length of segment $M_0M_1$.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Use the Midsegment Theorem\n\nIn any triangle, the segment connecting the midpoints of two sides is called a **midsegment**. The **Midsegment Theorem** states:\n\n> The segment connecting the midpoints of two sides of a triangle is **parallel** to the third side and **half its length**.\n\nIn triangle $ABC$, $M_0$ is the midpoint of $AB$, and $M_1$ is the midpoint of $AC$. Therefore, segment $M_0M_1$ is the midsegment connecting sides $AB$ and $AC$, and it is parallel to side $BC$, and its length is half the length of $BC$.\n\nSince $BC = 7$, then:\n\n$$\nM_0M_1 = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 7 = \\boxed{3.5}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Verification via Coordinate Geometry (Optional but Confirming)\n\nTo verify, let’s place triangle $ABC$ on the coordinate plane.\n\nLet’s place point $A$ at $(0, 0)$, point $B$ at $(7, 0)$, and since triangle $ABC$ is equilateral, point $C$ will be at the top of the equilateral triangle.\n\nThe height $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $s$ is:\n\n$$\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 7 = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n$$\n\nSo, point $C$ is at the midpoint of $AB$ in the x-direction, and height $h$ in the y-direction:\n\n$$\nC = \\left( \\frac{0 + 7}{2}, \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right) = \\left( 3.5, \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\right)\n$$\n\nNow, find midpoints:\n\n- $M_0$ = midpoint of $AB$: $A = (0,0), B = (7,0)$ → $M_0 = \\left( \\frac{0+7}{2}, \\frac{0+0}{2} \\right) = (3.5, 0)$\n- $M_1$ = midpoint of $AC$: $A = (0,0), C = (3.5, \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2})$ → $M_1 = \\left( \\frac{0 + 3.5}{2}, \\frac{0 + \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2}}{2} \\right) = \\left( 1.75, \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\right)$\n\nNow compute distance between $M_0 = (3.5, 0)$ and $M_1 = (1.75, \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{4})$:\n\nUse distance formula:\n\n$$\nM_0M_1 = \\sqrt{(3.5 - 1.75)^2 + \\left(0 - \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\right)^2}\n= \\sqrt{(1.75)^2 + \\left( \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\right)^2}\n$$\n\nCompute each term:\n\n- $1.75 = \\frac{7}{4}$, so $(1.75)^2 = \\left( \\frac{7}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{49}{16}$\n- $\\left( \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{4} \\right)^2 = \\frac{49 \\cdot 3}{16} = \\frac{147}{16}$\n\nAdd:\n\n$$\n\\frac{49}{16} + \\frac{147}{16} = \\frac{196}{16} = \\frac{49}{4}\n$$\n\nTake square root:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{\\frac{49}{4}} = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5\n$$\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{3.5}\n$$"
