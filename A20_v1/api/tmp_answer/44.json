    "In the given geometric figure, a larger triangle DEF is constructed concentrically around a smaller triangle ABC, both sharing the same center O1. Triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 6 and is rotated by π/3 radians relative to triangle DEF. Points M0 and M1 are the midpoints of sides DE and AC, respectively. A line segment M0M1 is drawn connecting these two midpoints.\n\nWhat is the length of segment M0M1?"
