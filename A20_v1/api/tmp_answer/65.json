    "We are given a geometric construction involving three triangles:\n\n- Triangle 1: Centered at **O1**, regular (equilateral) triangle with side length **4**.\n- Triangle 2: Centered at **O2**, derived by placing **one of its vertices at O1**, and having the **same radius** (i.e., same circumradius) as the first triangle.\n- Triangle 3: Centered at **O3**, obtained by **translating** the second triangle to the right.\n\nWe are to find the length of segment **GH**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the structure\n\nLet’s first clarify what “radius” means here. Since the triangles are regular (equilateral), and centered at O1, O2, O3, the “radius” likely refers to the **circumradius** — the distance from the center to any vertex.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle with side length **s**, the circumradius **R** is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nWait — actually, that’s incorrect.\n\nThe correct formula for the **circumradius** of an equilateral triangle is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\text{Wait — let’s derive it properly.}\n\\]\n\nActually, in an equilateral triangle, the centroid (which coincides with circumcenter, incenter, etc.) is located at a distance of:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\text{height}?\n\\]\n\nBetter to recall:\n\nHeight of equilateral triangle: \\( h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s \\)\n\nThe centroid (and circumcenter) is located at 2/3 of the height from a vertex, so:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot h = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} s = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nWait — actually, \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), so yes:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{R = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}}\n\\]\n\nBut let’s verify with s = 4:\n\nHeight = \\( \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 4 = 2\\sqrt{3} \\)\n\nCentroid is 2/3 of the way from vertex to base → distance from center to vertex is 2/3 of height? No — wait, **from vertex to centroid is 2/3 of the median**, so yes, circumradius R = 2/3 * height = \\( \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 2\\sqrt{3} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\)\n\nAh! So correction:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} s = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo correct formula:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{R = \\frac{s \\sqrt{3}}{3}}\n\\]\n\nFor s = 4:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{4 \\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Analyze triangle centered at O1\n\nTriangle centered at O1, side length 4. Let’s assume it’s oriented with one vertex pointing to the right — since point A is on the right, and lines go from A to B and C, and O1 is inside.\n\nFrom the diagram, triangle ABC is centered at O1? Wait — points A, B, C are vertices? Let’s look:\n\nIn the diagram:\n\n- Triangle with vertices A, B, C — centered at O1? But O1 is inside triangle ABC? Actually, from the drawing, triangle ABC has vertices A, B, C, and O1 is inside it. But the problem says “a regular triangle centered at O1” — so likely triangle ABC is the first triangle, centered at O1.\n\nBut then it says: “a second triangle centered at O2 is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1, with radius equal to that of the base triangle.”\n\nSo second triangle has one vertex at O1, and same circumradius R = \\( \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\).\n\nSo second triangle is also equilateral, side length 4, circumradius R, and one of its vertices is at O1.\n\nSo, if we place a vertex of the second triangle at O1, and the center of that triangle is O2, then the distance from O2 to O1 is equal to the circumradius R.\n\nBecause in any regular triangle, the distance from center to vertex is R.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nO1O2 = R = \\frac{4\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\nNow, the second triangle is centered at O2, and has one vertex at O1.\n\nWhat are the other vertices? From the diagram, we see points D, E, and C? Wait — the second triangle seems to be DEC? Or D, E, and another point?\n\nLooking at the diagram:\n\n- Points D, E, C form a triangle? D and E are on the left, C is on the right. O2 is inside triangle DEC.\n\nAnd O1 is a vertex of triangle DEC? From the diagram, line from D to C passes through O1? Not exactly — but O1 is on the line from D to C? Wait, no — actually, from the diagram, O1 is inside triangle ABC, and also appears to be on the side of triangle DEC? Hmm.\n\nWait — perhaps triangle DEC is the second triangle, centered at O2, and vertex C is at O1? But point C is labeled, and O1 is a separate point.\n\nActually, looking at the diagram:\n\n- Triangle ABC: vertices A, B, C — centered at O1.\n- Triangle DEC: vertices D, E, C — centered at O2.\n- Triangle FGH: vertices F, G, H — centered at O3.\n\nAnd O1 is a vertex of triangle DEC? From the diagram, point C is shared between triangle ABC and triangle DEC. But O1 is not C — O1 is inside triangle ABC.\n\nWait — the problem says: “a second triangle centered at O2 is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1”\n\nSo one vertex of the second triangle is **O1**.\n\nSo the second triangle has vertices: let’s say P, Q, O1, centered at O2.\n\nBut in the diagram, the second triangle is labeled with points D, E, C — and O2 is inside it.\n\nSo perhaps one of D, E, or C is O1? But O1 is a separate red dot.\n\nWait — perhaps the second triangle has vertices D, E, and O1? But O1 is not labeled as a vertex — it’s labeled as a center.\n\nThis is confusing.\n\nAlternative interpretation:\n\nPerhaps the first triangle is ABC, centered at O1.\n\nThen, the second triangle is constructed such that **one of its vertices is placed at O1**, and its center is O2, and it has the same circumradius.\n\nSo the second triangle has center O2, and one vertex at O1 → so distance O1O2 = R.\n\nThen, the second triangle is rotated or oriented in some way.\n\nFrom the diagram, the second triangle appears to be DEC, with O2 inside it, and point C is shared with triangle ABC.\n\nBut point C is a vertex of triangle ABC — so if O1 is the center of ABC, then C is a vertex, so distance O1C = R.\n\nSimilarly, if the second triangle has a vertex at O1, and center O2, then O1O2 = R.\n\nSo perhaps triangle DEC has vertices D, E, and O1? But in the diagram, point C is labeled, and O1 is separate.\n\nWait — maybe point C in the diagram is actually O1? But no, O1 is marked as a red dot inside triangle ABC, and C is a vertex.\n\nPerhaps there’s a mislabeling or we need to reinterpret.\n\nLet’s look at the diagram again:\n\n- Triangle ABC: A on right, B top, C bottom — O1 inside.\n- Triangle DEC: D top left, E bottom left, C bottom right — O2 inside.\n- Triangle FGH: G top, H bottom, F right — O3 inside.\n\nNotice that point C is shared between triangle ABC and triangle DEC.\n\nAlso, O1 is inside ABC, O2 inside DEC, O3 inside FGH.\n\nThe problem says: “a second triangle centered at O2 is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1”\n\nSo one vertex of triangle DEC is O1? But in the diagram, the vertices are D, E, C — none labeled O1.\n\nUnless... point C is O1? But O1 is a separate point.\n\nWait — perhaps the diagram is schematic, and point C is meant to be O1? That would make sense.\n\nBecause if triangle ABC is centered at O1, then C is a vertex, so O1C = R.\n\nThen, if the second triangle"
