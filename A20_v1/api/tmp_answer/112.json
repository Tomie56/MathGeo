    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 undergoes two derivation rounds: first, a circum-inscribed pentagon (also centered at O1) is formed; second, a triangle centered at O2 is derived via the vertex-on-center rule, with side length equal to that of the base pentagon. The final figure comprises 14 labeled points, 13 line segments, and no arcs. In the final configuration, points K and L lie on distinct edges of the outer pentagon, and segment KL passes through O1. Additionally, point A and point C are connected by a line segment, intersecting other elements of the figure. \n\nWhat is the measure of angle K-O1-L in radians?"
