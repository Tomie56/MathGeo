    "In the given geometric construction, a larger equilateral triangle DEF is concentric with and twice the scale of a smaller equilateral triangle ABC, both centered at point O1. Points M0 and M1 are the midpoints of segments BC and AD, respectively. A new line segment M0M1 is drawn connecting these two midpoints. Given that the side length of the inner triangle ABC is 6, what is the length of segment M0M1?"

    "We are given a geometric construction with two concentric equilateral triangles: a smaller one, ABC, and a larger one, DEF, with DEF being **twice the scale** of ABC and both centered at point O1. We are told that:\n\n- Side length of ABC = 6.\n- M0 is the midpoint of BC.\n- M1 is the midpoint of AD.\n- We are to find the length of segment M0M1.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\nSince both triangles are **equilateral** and **concentric**, and DEF is **twice the scale** of ABC, we can assume that DEF is a scaled-up version of ABC by a factor of 2, centered at O1.\n\nThis implies that each vertex of DEF lies on the ray from O1 through the corresponding vertex of ABC, at twice the distance.\n\nSo, if we let O1 be the origin for simplicity, we can assign coordinates to the points based on this scaling.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Place triangle ABC in coordinate plane\n\nLet’s place triangle ABC with center O1 at the origin (0, 0), and orient it with point A at the top for simplicity.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle centered at the origin, we can use standard coordinates.\n\nLet’s define the coordinates of ABC such that:\n\n- The centroid (which for an equilateral triangle coincides with the center O1) is at (0, 0).\n- The side length is 6.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the distance from the centroid to a vertex is:\n\n> **R = (side length) / √3**\n\nWait — actually, the formula for the distance from centroid to a vertex in an equilateral triangle is:\n\n> **R = (2/3) × height**\n\nHeight of equilateral triangle with side s is:  \n> **h = (√3 / 2) × s**\n\nSo,\n\n> **R = (2/3) × (√3 / 2) × s = (√3 / 3) × s = s / √3**\n\nSo for s = 6,\n\n> **R = 6 / √3 = 2√3**\n\nSo each vertex is at distance 2√3 from the center.\n\nLet’s assign coordinates:\n\nPlace point A at the top:  \n> A = (0, 2√3)\n\nThen, since it’s equilateral and centered at origin, the other two points B and C are at 120° and 240° from the positive y-axis (or equivalently, 30°, 150°, 270° from x-axis — we’ll use standard position).\n\nActually, to make it symmetric, let’s use angles from the positive x-axis.\n\nStandard placement for equilateral triangle centered at origin:\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- A: at angle 90° (top)\n- B: at angle 210°\n- C: at angle 330°\n\nSo coordinates:\n\n> A = (R cos(90°), R sin(90°)) = (0, R) = (0, 2√3)\n\n> B = (R cos(210°), R sin(210°)) = (2√3 × cos(210°), 2√3 × sin(210°))\n\ncos(210°) = cos(180°+30°) = -cos(30°) = -√3/2  \nsin(210°) = -sin(30°) = -1/2\n\nSo:\n\n> B = (2√3 × (-√3/2), 2√3 × (-1/2)) = (-3, -√3)\n\nSimilarly,\n\n> C = (R cos(330°), R sin(330°)) = (2√3 × cos(330°), 2√3 × sin(330°))\n\ncos(330°) = cos(-30°) = √3/2  \nsin(330°) = -1/2\n\nSo:\n\n> C = (2√3 × √3/2, 2√3 × (-1/2)) = (3, -√3)\n\n✅ So we have:\n\n- A = (0, 2√3)\n- B = (-3, -√3)\n- C = (3, -√3)\n\nCheck distance AB:\n\nAB² = (0 - (-3))² + (2√3 - (-√3))² = 9 + (3√3)² = 9 + 27 = 36 → AB = 6 ✔️\n\nSimilarly, BC: from (-3, -√3) to (3, -√3) → distance = 6 ✔️\n\nAC: from (0, 2√3) to (3, -√3):  \nΔx = 3, Δy = -3√3 → distance² = 9 + 27 = 36 → AC = 6 ✔️\n\nPerfect.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Find coordinates of D, E, F\n\nSince DEF is twice the scale and concentric, each vertex is twice as far from O1 as the corresponding vertex of ABC.\n\nSo:\n\n> D = 2 × A = 2 × (0, 2√3) = (0, 4√3)  \n> E = 2 × B = 2 × (-3, -√3) = (-6, -2√3)  \n> F = 2 × C = 2 × (3, -√3) = (6, -2√3)\n\n✅ Check side length of DEF:\n\nDE: from D(0, 4√3) to E(-6, -2√3)\n\nΔx = -6, Δy = -6√3 → distance² = 36 + 108 = 144 → DE = 12 ✔️\n\nEF: from E(-6, -2√3) to F(6, -2√3) → distance = 12 ✔️\n\nFD: from F(6, -2√3) to D(0, 4√3) → Δx = -6, Δy = 6√3 → distance² = 36 + 108 = 144 → FD = 12 ✔️\n\nGood.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Find midpoints M0 and M1\n\n- M0 is midpoint of BC\n\nB = (-3, -√3), C = (3, -√3)\n\nMidpoint M0 = ((-3 + 3)/2, (-√3 + (-√3))/2) = (0, -√3)\n\n- M1 is midpoint of AD\n\nA = (0, 2√3), D = (0, 4√3)\n\nMidpoint M1 = ((0 + 0)/2, (2√3 + 4√3)/2) = (0, 3√3)\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Find distance between M0 and M1\n\nM0 = (0, -√3)  \nM1 = (0, 3√3)\n\nSame x-coordinate → vertical line.\n\nDistance = |3√3 - (-√3)| = |4√3| = **4√3**\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{4\\sqrt{3}}\n$$"
