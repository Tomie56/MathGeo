    "We are given two congruent squares: square ABCD centered at O₁ and square EFGH centered at O₂. Square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD **perpendicularly to side CD**. We are also told that M₀ is the midpoint of segment BC, and we are to connect H to M₀ — but **this is a red herring** for the actual question.\n\nThe actual question is:\n\n> Express the angle at vertex A formed by segments AB and AD — that is, ∠BAD — as a radian expression.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometric figure\n\nWe are dealing with **square ABCD**. In any square, all interior angles are **right angles**, i.e., 90 degrees.\n\nVertex A is one corner of the square. Segments AB and AD are two adjacent sides meeting at A.\n\nTherefore, ∠BAD is the angle between two adjacent sides of the square.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Recall the measure of an interior angle of a square\n\nIn Euclidean geometry, a square is a regular quadrilateral. All interior angles are equal and each measures:\n\n> 90 degrees\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Convert degrees to radians\n\nTo convert degrees to radians, use the formula:\n\n\\[\n\\text{radians} = \\text{degrees} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n90^\\circ = 90 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Address possible distractions\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n- A second square EFGH, obtained by translating ABCD perpendicularly to side CD.\n- Point M₀, midpoint of BC.\n- Connecting H to M₀.\n\nHowever, **none of this affects ∠BAD**, which is an intrinsic property of square ABCD. The angle at vertex A is determined solely by the square’s geometry and does not depend on translations or other constructions unless the question asked about angles involving those new points.\n\nSince the question specifically asks for ∠BAD — the angle at vertex A between sides AB and AD — and since ABCD is a square, the answer is simply the interior angle of a square in radians.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n\\]"
