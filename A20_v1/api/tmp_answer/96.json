    "In the given diagram, a regular pentagon with center O1 and side length 4 is inscribed within another regular pentagon of the same center, forming a concentric structure. Points A, B, C, D, E are the vertices of the outer pentagon in clockwise order, and points F, G, H, I, J lie on the inner pentagon, with F on segment AB, G on BC, H on CD, I on DE, and J on EA. Segment BE is drawn, intersecting the inner pentagon at points I1 and I2. What is the radian value of the angle between line AB and line EA at vertex A?"

    "We are given a diagram with two **concentric regular pentagons** — an outer one with vertices A, B, C, D, E (in clockwise order), and an inner one with vertices F, G, H, I, J, where each inner vertex lies on a side of the outer pentagon (F on AB, G on BC, etc.). Segment BE is drawn and intersects the inner pentagon at points I1 and I2. However, the **question asks**:\n\n> What is the **radian value** of the angle between line AB and line EA at vertex A?\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometric context\n\nWe are to find the **interior angle** at vertex A of the **outer regular pentagon** — that is, the angle between sides AB and EA, which meet at vertex A.\n\nIn a **regular pentagon**, all interior angles are equal. The formula for the interior angle of a regular polygon with $ n $ sides is:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{n} \\quad \\text{(in radians)}\n$$\n\nFor a pentagon, $ n = 5 $:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(5 - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{5} = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm the angle is at vertex A between AB and EA\n\nIn polygon ABCDE (clockwise), the sides meeting at vertex A are:\n\n- Side EA (coming from E to A)\n- Side AB (going from A to B)\n\nSo the angle between vectors **EA** and **AB** at vertex A is indeed the **interior angle** of the pentagon at A.\n\nNote: The direction matters — since the pentagon is labeled clockwise, the interior angle is still the same as for a counterclockwise labeling, because interior angle is a geometric property independent of traversal direction.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nThus, the radian measure of the angle between line AB and line EA at vertex A is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Note on Irrelevant Details\n\nThe problem mentions the inner pentagon, points F, G, H, I, J, and segment BE intersecting the inner pentagon at I1 and I2. However, **none of these are needed** to compute the angle at vertex A of the outer pentagon. The question is purely about the interior angle of a regular pentagon.\n\nThis is a common trick in geometry problems — to include extra information to test whether the solver can identify the relevant elements.\n\n---\n\n✅ Final Answer: $ \\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}} $"
