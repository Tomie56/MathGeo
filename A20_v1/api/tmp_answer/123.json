    "In the given geometric construction, a regular octagon centered at O1 with side length 10 is inscribed in a circle centered at O1. A second triangle (3-gon) centered at O2 is derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1, and its side length equals that of the octagon. The points I and J are vertices of this triangle, with O1 serving as one vertex. Considering the angle ∠IO1J formed by segments O1I and JO1, express this angle in radians."

    "We are given a geometric construction involving:\n\n- A **regular octagon** centered at **O1**, inscribed in a circle centered at O1, with **side length 10**.\n- A **triangle (3-gon)** centered at **O2**, with **one vertex at O1**, and **side length also 10**.\n- Points **I** and **J** are the other two vertices of this triangle.\n- We are to find the angle **∠IO1J**, i.e., the angle at vertex **O1** between segments **O1I** and **O1J**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the triangle centered at O2\n\nThe triangle is described as a **3-gon centered at O2**, with **one vertex at O1**, and **side length 10**. Since it’s a 3-gon (triangle) and centered at O2, and one vertex is at O1, it is **equilateral** (since all sides are equal to 10, and it’s regular by implication of being a “3-gon centered at O2”).\n\nThus, the triangle **O1IJ** is an **equilateral triangle** with side length 10.\n\n> **Important**: The problem says “a second triangle (3-gon) centered at O2 is derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1, and its side length equals that of the octagon.” So the triangle has vertices O1, I, J, all separated by 10 units, and centered at O2.\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle**, all internal angles are **60 degrees**, or **π/3 radians**.\n\nTherefore, the angle at **O1**, which is ∠IO1J, is simply the internal angle of the equilateral triangle at vertex O1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm the triangle is equilateral\n\nWe are told:\n\n- Side length = 10 (same as octagon’s side).\n- It’s a 3-gon centered at O2 → implies regular triangle → equilateral.\n- One vertex is at O1 → so the other two vertices I and J are placed such that O1I = O1J = IJ = 10.\n\nThus, triangle O1IJ is equilateral.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute angle ∠IO1J\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, every internal angle is:\n\n> **60° = π/3 radians**\n\nSo,\n\n> ∠IO1J = π/3 radians\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
