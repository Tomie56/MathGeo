    "In the given diagram, triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle centered at O1, with all three vertices A, B, and C lying on the circle. The triangle is equilateral with side length 7. Express the measure of angle BAC — formed by segments AB and AC at vertex A — as a radian expression."

    "We are given that triangle $ABC$ is **equilateral** and **inscribed in a circle** centered at $O_1$. All three vertices lie on the circle, and the side length is 7. We are to find the measure of angle $BAC$ in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle**, all three sides are equal, and all three interior angles are equal.\n\nSince the sum of interior angles in any triangle is $\\pi$ radians (or $180^\\circ$), each angle in an equilateral triangle is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify angle BAC\n\nAngle $BAC$ is the angle at vertex $A$, formed by segments $AB$ and $AC$. In triangle $ABC$, this is one of the three interior angles.\n\nSince triangle $ABC$ is equilateral, angle $BAC = \\frac{\\pi}{3}$ radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm with circle geometry (optional verification)\n\nEven though the triangle is inscribed in a circle, the fact that it is **equilateral** implies that the central angles subtended by each side are equal. The entire circle is $2\\pi$ radians, so each arc between two vertices (e.g., arc $BC$, arc $AC$, arc $AB$) corresponds to a central angle of $\\frac{2\\pi}{3}$ radians.\n\nThe inscribed angle (like angle $BAC$) subtended by arc $BC$ is **half** the central angle subtended by the same arc. So:\n\n$$\n\\angle BAC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{central angle subtended by arc } BC = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\n$$\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
