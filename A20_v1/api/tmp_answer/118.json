    "In the given diagram, a regular octagon with side length 10 is inscribed in a circle centered at O1. Points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H are the vertices of the octagon in counterclockwise order. A triangle I-J-O2 is constructed such that O2 is the center of a new equilateral triangle with side length equal to that of the octagon, and points I and J lie on the circle centered at O1. Line segments O1-I and O1-J are drawn, forming angle ∠I-O1-J at the center O1. Given that the octagon is rotated by π/8 radians relative to the standard position, and that point C is connected to point A (both vertices of the octagon), determine the radian measure of angle ∠I-O1-J."
