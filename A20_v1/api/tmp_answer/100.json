    "Let’s carefully analyze the problem step by step.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometric setup\n\nWe are told:\n\n- There is a **regular pentagon** centered at **O1**, with **side length 8**.\n- It is **inscribed within another regular pentagon** (also centered at O1) via a “circum-inscribe operation”. This likely means the inner pentagon is inscribed in the outer one — i.e., the vertices of the inner pentagon lie on the sides or edges of the outer pentagon. But since both are centered at O1 and regular, it’s more likely that the inner pentagon is scaled down and rotated relative to the outer one, sharing the same center.\n- A **third polygon** — an **equilateral triangle** centered at **O2** — is derived such that **one of its vertices coincides with the center O2**, and its **side length equals that of the original pentagon (i.e., 8)**.\n- Points **F and G** are **adjacent vertices of the inner pentagon**.\n- We are to find the **length of segment FG**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Clarify what FG is\n\nSince F and G are **adjacent vertices of the inner pentagon**, and the inner pentagon is **regular** with side length 8, then **FG is simply a side of the inner pentagon**.\n\n> Therefore, **FG = 8**.\n\nWait — is that too straightforward? Let’s double-check.\n\nThe problem says:\n\n> “a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation.”\n\nThis might suggest that the inner pentagon is inscribed *in* the outer one — meaning its vertices lie on the outer pentagon’s sides or circumcircle. But if both are regular and concentric, and the inner one has side length 8, then unless specified otherwise, **FG is just a side of that inner pentagon**, so length 8.\n\nBut then why mention the equilateral triangle centered at O2? And why mention O2 at all?\n\nLet’s read again:\n\n> “A third polygon — an equilateral triangle centered at O2 — is derived such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O2, and its side length equals that of the original pentagon.”\n\nThis is geometrically **impossible** if interpreted literally.\n\nAn **equilateral triangle centered at O2**, with **one vertex at O2**, and side length 8 — this is **not possible** in Euclidean geometry.\n\nWhy?\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the **center** (centroid, circumcenter, etc.) is **not a vertex**. The centroid is located at the intersection of the medians, and is **inside** the triangle, not at a vertex.\n\nSo if one vertex **coincides with the center O2**, then O2 is a vertex of the triangle — but then it cannot be the center of the triangle unless the triangle is degenerate (which it’s not, since side length is 8).\n\nThis suggests either:\n\n1. There is a **misstatement** in the problem, or\n2. “centered at O2” is being used loosely, or\n3. The triangle is not centered in the usual sense — perhaps O2 is the center of the triangle’s circumcircle, but one vertex is at O2 — which again is impossible unless the triangle has zero size.\n\nWait — perhaps the problem meant:\n\n> “...such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O1...” — but it says O2.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps “centered at O2” is a red herring, or perhaps O2 is just a point near the triangle, not the geometric center.\n\nBut the problem says:\n\n> “A third polygon — an equilateral triangle centered at O2 — is derived such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O2...”\n\nThis is **geometrically contradictory**.\n\nUnless... perhaps “centered at O2” means that O2 is the **centroid**, and one vertex is at O2 — which is impossible for a non-degenerate triangle.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it’s a **degenerate triangle**? But side length is 8 — so not degenerate.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Re-evaluate the problem\n\nPerhaps the mention of the equilateral triangle and O2 is **irrelevant** to the question.\n\nThe question is:\n\n> “Determine the length of segment FG.”\n\nAnd we are told:\n\n> “Points F and G are adjacent vertices of the inner pentagon.”\n\nAnd the inner pentagon is **regular** with **side length 8**.\n\nTherefore, **FG is a side of the inner pentagon**, so **FG = 8**.\n\nThe rest of the description — about the outer pentagon, the circum-inscribe operation, the equilateral triangle centered at O2 — may be **distractors**, or perhaps there is a misstatement.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps “side length 8” refers to the **outer pentagon**, and the inner pentagon has a different side length?\n\nLet’s re-read:\n\n> “a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation.”\n\nThis is ambiguous.\n\nIt could mean:\n\n- The **inner pentagon** has side length 8, and is inscribed in the outer pentagon.\n\nOR\n\n- The **outer pentagon** has side length 8, and the inner one is inscribed in it.\n\nBut the sentence structure: “a regular pentagon ... with side length 8 is inscribed within another...” — suggests that the pentagon **with side length 8** is the **inner** one.\n\nSo inner pentagon: side length = 8.\n\nF and G are adjacent vertices of the inner pentagon → FG = side length = 8.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider if “circum-inscribe” implies scaling\n\nSometimes “circum-inscribe” might mean that the inner pentagon is inscribed in the circumcircle of the outer pentagon — but that would make them the same size if both are regular and concentric.\n\nAlternatively, if the inner pentagon is inscribed in the outer pentagon (i.e., its vertices lie on the sides of the outer pentagon), then the side length of the inner pentagon would be **less** than that of the outer.\n\nBut the problem says the inner pentagon **has side length 8**.\n\nSo unless the outer pentagon is larger, and the inner one is scaled down, but still has side length 8 — that doesn’t make sense.\n\nWait — perhaps the “original pentagon” is the outer one, and the inner one is derived from it.\n\nBut the sentence says:\n\n> “a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon...”\n\nSo the pentagon **with side length 8** is the one being inscribed — i.e., the **inner** one.\n\nThus, inner pentagon: side length = 8.\n\nF and G are adjacent vertices → FG = 8.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Address the equilateral triangle part\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n> “A third polygon — an equilateral triangle centered at O2 — is derived such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O2, and its side length equals that of the original pentagon.”\n\nThis is likely a **red herring** or a **mistake**.\n\nBecause:\n\n- If O2 is the center of the triangle, and also a vertex, then the triangle must be degenerate — which contradicts side length 8.\n\n- Alternatively, perhaps “centered at O2” is misstated, and O2 is just a point, not the center.\n\nBut even so, the question is about FG, which is part of the inner pentagon.\n\nUnless... perhaps FG is not a side of the pentagon, but a segment connecting F and G which are not adjacent? But the problem says “adjacent vertices”.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final conclusion\n\nGiven:\n\n- Inner pentagon is regular.\n- Side length = 8.\n- F and G are adjacent vertices.\n\nTherefore, **FG = 8**.\n\nThe rest of the description appears to be either misleading, irrelevant, or contains an error (regarding the triangle).\n\nIn geometric problems, if a segment connects two adjacent vertices of a regular polygon, and the side length is given, then that segment’s length is simply the side length.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{8}\n$$"
