    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two concentric equilateral triangles: an inner triangle ABC and an outer triangle DEF, both centered at point O1, and sharing vertex A. The inner triangle ABC has side length 6, and the outer triangle DEF is a scaled version of ABC by a factor of 2, concentrically about O1.\n\nWe are told that point F0 lies on segment BC such that AF0 is perpendicular to BC. However, this information is **not needed** to answer the question: **“Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by lines AB and AC at vertex A.”**\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the nature of triangle ABC\n\nThe problem states that the inner triangle is a **regular triangle** — that is, an **equilateral triangle** — with side length 6. Since it is equilateral, **all internal angles are equal**.\n\nIn any equilateral triangle, each internal angle measures:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians} \\quad \\text{(since } 60^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians)}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the angle at vertex A\n\nThe angle formed by lines AB and AC at vertex A is the **internal angle** of triangle ABC at vertex A.\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral, this angle is:\n\n\\[\n\\angle BAC = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider the role of scaling and point F0\n\nThe problem mentions that triangle DEF is a scaled version of ABC by factor 2, concentrically about O1, and that point F0 lies on BC such that AF0 ⊥ BC. However, **none of this affects the internal angle at A in triangle ABC**.\n\n- Scaling concentrically preserves angles.\n- The perpendicular from A to BC (AF0) is an altitude, which in an equilateral triangle also bisects the angle — but again, we are not being asked about that segment or any derived angles; we are being asked for the angle between AB and AC, which is the vertex angle of the equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n\\]"
