    "Two circles intersect at points A and C. The left circle, centered at O₁, circumscribes an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 9. The right circle, centered at O₂, is a translation of the left circle to the right. Segment AC is common to both circles and is vertical. Point B lies on the left circle and forms triangle ABC. What is the measure of angle BAC in radians?"

    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two intersecting circles and an equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given information\n\n- Two circles intersect at points **A** and **C**.\n- The **left circle** is centered at **O₁** and **circumscribes** an equilateral triangle **ABC** with side length **9**.\n- The **right circle** is a **translation** of the left circle to the right — meaning it has the **same radius** and is shifted horizontally.\n- Segment **AC** is **vertical** and is **common** to both circles (i.e., it is the common chord).\n- Point **B** lies on the left circle and forms triangle **ABC**.\n- We are to find the measure of angle **BAC** in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use properties of equilateral triangles\n\nSince triangle **ABC** is **equilateral**, **all sides are equal** (AB = BC = CA = 9), and **all internal angles are 60°**.\n\nTherefore, angle **BAC = 60°**.\n\nBut the question asks for the answer in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Convert degrees to radians\n\nWe know:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ = \\pi \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n60^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Verify consistency with the diagram\n\nThe diagram shows:\n\n- Points A and C are intersection points of the two circles.\n- Segment AC is vertical.\n- Point B is on the left circle, forming triangle ABC.\n- Since the triangle is equilateral and inscribed in the left circle, the circle is the **circumcircle** of triangle ABC.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the circumcenter (O₁) is also the centroid and orthocenter, and lies at equal distance from all three vertices.\n\nThe fact that AC is vertical and B is to the left (as shown in the diagram) is consistent with an equilateral triangle oriented with base AC vertical and vertex B to the left.\n\nThus, angle BAC is indeed an internal angle of an equilateral triangle → **60°** → **π/3 radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n\\]"
