    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at point O1 with side length 8 is initially drawn. Through two rounds of derivation — first inscribing a congruent pentagon within it (also centered at O1), then constructing a triangle centered at O2 such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O1 and its side length equals that of the original pentagon — a complex figure with 14 labeled points and 13 line segments is formed. Among these, segment O1D is explicitly drawn, connecting center O1 to point D, which lies on an edge of the inner pentagon.\n\nDetermine the length of segment O1D."
