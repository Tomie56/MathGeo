    "We are given two identical squares, ABCD and EFGH, each with side length 7. Square EFGH is translated perpendicularly from side CD of square ABCD, sharing vertex H with vertex C. We are to find the **radian value of the angle between line AB and line DA at vertex A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the configuration at vertex A\n\nWe are focusing **only** on square ABCD and the angle at vertex A between sides AB and DA.\n\nIn any square, **all interior angles are 90 degrees**, or **π/2 radians**.\n\nThis is a fundamental property of squares: all four angles are right angles.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm the labeling of square ABCD\n\nAssuming standard labeling of square ABCD in clockwise or counterclockwise order:\n\n- If we go A → B → C → D → A, then at vertex A, the two sides meeting are AB and AD (or DA, depending on direction).\n\nThe angle between AB and DA at vertex A is the **interior angle** of the square at A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Ignore extraneous information\n\nThe problem mentions square EFGH, its position, centers O1 and O2, and other points — but **none of this affects the angle at vertex A of square ABCD**.\n\nThe angle between AB and DA at A is purely a property of square ABCD, which is a square with side length 7 — but the side length doesn’t affect the angle (all squares have 90° angles).\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Convert 90 degrees to radians\n\nWe know:\n\n> 180° = π radians  \n> ⇒ 90° = π/2 radians\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n$$"
