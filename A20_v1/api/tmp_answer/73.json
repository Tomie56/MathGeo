    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 4 undergoes two derivation rounds: first, a vertex-on-center expansion yielding triangle O2, and second, a rightward translation yielding triangle O3. Point A is a shared vertex between the original and translated triangles, and M0 is the midpoint of segment GF (labeled as L6 in the construction). A new line segment, Line_A_M0, is drawn connecting point A to point M0.\n\nWhat is the length of segment AM₀?"
