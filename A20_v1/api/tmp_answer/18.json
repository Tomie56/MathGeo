    "Two circles intersect at points A and C. The left circle, centered at O₁, passes through vertices A, B, and C of an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 9. The right circle, centered at O₂, is a translation of the left circle to the right and also passes through A and C. Point B lies on the left circle only. The arc BC (denoted Arc_B_C) is the minor arc along the circumference of the left circle connecting points B and C.\n\nFind the length of Arc_B_C."

    "We are given:\n\n- Two circles intersect at points A and C.\n- The left circle is centered at O₁ and passes through A, B, and C — forming an **equilateral triangle ABC** with side length 9.\n- The right circle is a **translation** of the left circle to the right and also passes through A and C.\n- Point B lies **only** on the left circle.\n- We are to find the **length of the minor arc BC** on the **left circle** (Arc_B_C).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Geometry\n\nSince triangle ABC is **equilateral** with side length 9, and all three points lie on the **left circle** (centered at O₁), then **O₁ is the circumcenter** of triangle ABC.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the **circumcenter** coincides with the **centroid**, **orthocenter**, and **incenter**.\n\nThe **circumradius R** of an equilateral triangle with side length $ s $ is:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nWait — let’s double-check that.\n\nActually, the correct formula for the circumradius $ R $ of an equilateral triangle is:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{2} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\quad \\text{?}\n$$\n\nNo — let’s derive it properly.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the height $ h $ is:\n\n$$\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s\n$$\n\nThe centroid (which is also the circumcenter) lies at $ \\frac{2}{3} $ of the height from any vertex.\n\nSo the distance from a vertex to the circumcenter is:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot h = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} s = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nWait — actually, $ \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} $, so yes:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\quad \\text{?}\n$$\n\nBut let’s verify with a known value.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle of side 1, the circumradius is $ \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} $? Actually, no — standard formula is:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\quad \\text{is incorrect.}\n$$\n\nCorrect formula:\n\nIn any triangle, circumradius $ R = \\frac{abc}{4A} $. For equilateral triangle, $ a = b = c = s $, and area $ A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 $.\n\nSo:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s \\cdot s \\cdot s}{4 \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2} = \\frac{s^3}{\\sqrt{3} s^2} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nWait — that gives $ R = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} $, but this is **not** standard. Let me check numerically.\n\nTake s = 2. Then height = √3 ≈ 1.732. Centroid is at 2/3 of height from vertex → distance from vertex to centroid = 2/3 * √3 ≈ 1.1547.\n\nBut $ \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{3}} ≈ 1.1547 $ — yes! So:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\quad \\text{is correct?}\n$$\n\nWait — no: if s = 2, then R = 2 / √3 ≈ 1.1547 — which matches the centroid distance. But in an equilateral triangle, the **circumradius** is the distance from the center to a **vertex**, which is exactly what we just calculated.\n\nSo yes, **R = s / √3**.\n\nBut wait — standard formula is often written as:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} s\n$$\n\nYes, that’s correct.\n\nSo for s = 9:\n\n$$\nR = \\frac{9}{\\sqrt{3}} = 3\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\n✅ So the radius of the left circle is $ 3\\sqrt{3} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the Central Angle ∠BO₁C\n\nWe need the **measure of the central angle** subtended by arc BC at center O₁.\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral, and O₁ is the circumcenter, the central angles corresponding to each side are equal.\n\nIn a circle, the central angle subtended by a chord is related to the arc.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, the central angles corresponding to each side are **120°**, because the full circle is 360°, and the triangle divides it into 3 equal arcs.\n\nWhy? Because each vertex is 120° apart around the circle.\n\nLet’s confirm:\n\nIn triangle ABC, each internal angle is 60°. The central angle subtended by an arc is **twice** the inscribed angle subtended by the same arc.\n\nBut here, we are looking at the central angle directly.\n\nSince the triangle is equilateral and inscribed, the arcs between the vertices are equal. So arc AB = arc BC = arc CA = 360° / 3 = 120°.\n\nTherefore, the central angle ∠BO₁C = 120°.\n\n✅ So the arc BC corresponds to a central angle of 120°.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute Arc Length\n\nArc length formula:\n\n$$\n\\text{Arc length} = R \\cdot \\theta\n$$\n\nwhere $ \\theta $ is in **radians**.\n\nConvert 120° to radians:\n\n$$\n120^\\circ = \\frac{120 \\pi}{180} = \\frac{2\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\nRadius $ R = 3\\sqrt{3} $\n\nSo,\n\n$$\n\\text{Arc length} = 3\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = 2\\pi \\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\n✅ The 3’s cancel.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2\\pi\\sqrt{3}}\n$$\n\nThis is the length of the minor arc BC on the left circle."
