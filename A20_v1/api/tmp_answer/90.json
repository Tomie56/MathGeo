    "We are given a **regular octagon** centered at point $ O_1 $, with vertices labeled $ A $ through $ H $ in **clockwise** order. All sides have length 3. We are to find the **radian measure** of angle $ \\angle BAH $, formed by segments $ AB $ and $ AH $ at vertex $ A $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular octagon\n\nA regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal interior angles. The central angle between two adjacent vertices (as seen from the center $ O_1 $) is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\nVertices are labeled clockwise: $ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H $, and then back to $ A $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Locate points B, A, and H\n\nWe are interested in angle $ \\angle BAH $, which is the angle at vertex $ A $ between points $ B $, $ A $, and $ H $.\n\nSo, we are looking at the angle formed by vectors $ \\vec{AB} $ and $ \\vec{AH} $, or equivalently, the angle between segments $ AB $ and $ AH $, with vertex at $ A $.\n\nIn the octagon, moving clockwise:\n\n- From $ A $ to $ B $: next vertex clockwise.\n- From $ A $ to $ H $: previous vertex (since it’s clockwise labeling, $ H $ comes before $ A $).\n\nSo, $ H $ and $ B $ are **adjacent to $ A $** — one on each side.\n\nTherefore, angle $ \\angle BAH $ is the **interior angle** of the regular octagon at vertex $ A $.\n\nWait — is that correct?\n\nLet’s double-check.\n\nIn polygon terminology, the interior angle at vertex $ A $ is the angle between the two edges meeting at $ A $, which are $ HA $ and $ AB $. So yes, $ \\angle BAH $ is exactly the **interior angle** of the octagon at vertex $ A $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Formula for interior angle of a regular polygon\n\nFor a regular $ n $-gon, the measure of each interior angle is:\n\n$$\n\\text{Interior angle} = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{n} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\nFor $ n = 8 $:\n\n$$\n\\text{Interior angle} = \\frac{(8 - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{8} = \\frac{6\\pi}{8} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm with geometry\n\nAlternatively, we can think in terms of the central angles.\n\nFrom center $ O_1 $, each vertex is separated by $ \\frac{\\pi}{4} $ radians.\n\nThe angle at vertex $ A $, $ \\angle BAH $, can also be found using the fact that in a regular polygon, the interior angle is supplementary to the central angle subtended by the side.\n\nBut more directly, since we’ve already used the standard formula and confirmed that $ \\angle BAH $ is the interior angle at vertex $ A $, and the polygon is regular, the answer is $ \\frac{3\\pi}{4} $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}\n$$"
