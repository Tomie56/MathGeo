    "We are given that triangle $ABC$ is **inscribed in a circle** centered at $O_1$, and that it is **equilateral** with side length 7. We are to find the **radian measure of angle $ \\angle BAC $**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle**, all three sides are equal, and all three interior angles are equal.\n\nSince the sum of the interior angles of any triangle is $ \\pi $ radians (or 180°), each angle in an equilateral triangle is:\n\n$$\n\\angle BAC = \\angle ABC = \\angle ACB = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm that the circle is the circumcircle\n\nThe problem states that triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in a circle centered at $O_1$, with vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$ on the circumference. This means the circle is the **circumcircle** of triangle $ABC$.\n\nHowever, **the fact that the triangle is inscribed in a circle does not change the measure of its interior angles**. The angles are determined solely by the triangle’s shape — and since it is equilateral, each angle is $ \\frac{\\pi}{3} $ radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Address possible confusion — central angle vs. inscribed angle\n\nSometimes in circle geometry, one might confuse the **central angle** (angle at the center $O_1$) with the **inscribed angle** (angle at the circumference, like $ \\angle BAC $).\n\nBut the question specifically asks for **angle $BAC$**, which is an **interior angle of the triangle**, and since the triangle is equilateral, we already know its measure.\n\nJust to clarify:\n\n- The **central angle** subtended by arc $BC$ would be $ \\angle BO_1C $, and for an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle, each central angle is $ \\frac{2\\pi}{3} $ radians (since the full circle is $2\\pi$, divided equally among 3 arcs).\n- The **inscribed angle** $ \\angle BAC $ subtends the same arc $BC$, and by the **Inscribed Angle Theorem**, it is **half** the central angle:\n\n$$\n\\angle BAC = \\frac{1}{2} \\angle BO_1C = \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\frac{2\\pi}{3} = \\frac{\\pi}{3}\n$$\n\nThis confirms our earlier result.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
