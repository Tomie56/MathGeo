    "We are given a geometric figure involving two triangles: a smaller equilateral triangle ABC and a larger triangle DEF, which is a scaled version of ABC by a factor of 2, centered at point O1. The triangles are concentric, and point A is a shared vertex of both triangles. Triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 6 and is rotated by π/3 radians. We are to find the angle at point A between segments AB and AC, expressed in radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of triangle ABC\n\nWe are told that triangle ABC is **equilateral**. By definition, an equilateral triangle has:\n\n- All three sides equal (given: side length = 6),\n- All three interior angles equal to **π/3 radians** (or 60 degrees).\n\nThis is a key fact: **In any equilateral triangle, each interior angle is π/3 radians.**\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Identify the angle at point A between AB and AC\n\nThe angle at point A between segments AB and AC is simply the **interior angle of triangle ABC at vertex A**.\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral, this angle is:\n\n> **∠BAC = π/3 radians**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider the rotation and scaling\n\nThe problem mentions that triangle ABC is rotated by π/3 radians and scaled to form triangle DEF. However, **rotation and scaling do not change the internal angles of a triangle**. Scaling preserves angles (it’s a similarity transformation), and rotation also preserves angles.\n\nMoreover, the question is **only asking for the angle at point A between AB and AC**, which are sides of the **original triangle ABC**. The rotation and scaling are red herrings for this specific question — they do not affect the internal angle at A in triangle ABC.\n\nEven though point A is shared with the larger triangle DEF, the angle between AB and AC is still defined within triangle ABC, and remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the angle at point A between line segments AB and AC is:\n\n> **π/3 radians**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
