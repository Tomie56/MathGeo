    "In the given diagram, a regular pentagon ABCDE with center O1 and side length 4 is inscribed within another regular pentagon FGHIJ, also centered at O1. All vertices lie on concentric circles, and the inner pentagon is rotated such that its vertices lie on the sides of the outer pentagon. Consider the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AE. What is the radian measure of ∠BAE?"

    "We are given a diagram with two concentric regular pentagons: an outer pentagon **ABCDE** and an inner pentagon **FGHIJ**, both centered at **O1**. The inner pentagon is rotated such that its vertices lie on the sides of the outer pentagon. We are to find the **radian measure of ∠BAE**, the angle at vertex **A** between segments **AB** and **AE**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure\n\nThe outer pentagon is labeled **ABCDE**, and it is **regular**. That means:\n\n- All sides are equal (given: side length = 4).\n- All interior angles are equal.\n- All vertices lie on a circle centered at **O1**.\n\nIn a **regular pentagon**, the **interior angle** at each vertex is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interior angle} = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{n} = \\frac{(5 - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{5} = \\frac{3\\pi}{5} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nSo, at vertex **A**, the angle between sides **AB** and **AE** — which are the two sides meeting at **A** — is exactly the **interior angle** of the pentagon.\n\nWait — let’s confirm the labeling.\n\nIn pentagon **ABCDE**, the vertices are labeled in order, say, clockwise or counterclockwise. So the sides at vertex **A** are **AB** and **AE** (since **E** is the previous vertex and **B** is the next). So yes, **∠BAE** is the interior angle at vertex **A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm that the inner pentagon does not affect ∠BAE\n\nThe problem mentions an inner pentagon **FGHIJ**, rotated and inscribed such that its vertices lie on the sides of the outer pentagon. However, the question asks for **∠BAE**, which is an angle **of the outer pentagon at vertex A**, formed by its own sides **AB** and **AE**.\n\nThe presence of the inner pentagon does **not** alter the geometry of the outer pentagon — it is still regular, and the angle at **A** remains the same as in any regular pentagon.\n\nTherefore, we can ignore the inner pentagon for the purpose of computing **∠BAE**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Compute the interior angle of a regular pentagon in radians\n\nAs derived above:\n\n\\[\n\\angle BAE = \\frac{(5 - 2)\\pi}{5} = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}}\n\\]"
