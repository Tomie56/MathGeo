    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon with center O1 and side length 4 is inscribed within another regular pentagon of the same center, forming a concentric dual-pentagon structure. Points A, B, E lie on the outer pentagon, with segment BE drawn as a diagonal connecting two non-adjacent vertices. At vertex A, lines AB and AE are adjacent sides of the outer pentagon. What is the radian value of the angle between line AB and line EA at vertex A?"

    "We are given a geometric construction involving two **concentric regular pentagons**, with center O1. The inner pentagon is inscribed within the outer one, sharing the same center. We are told that points A, B, and E lie on the **outer pentagon**, and that segment BE is a **diagonal** connecting two non-adjacent vertices. Also, AB and AE are **adjacent sides** of the outer pentagon.\n\nWe are to find the **radian measure of the angle between line AB and line EA at vertex A** — that is, the **interior angle** of the regular pentagon at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry of a regular pentagon\n\nA **regular pentagon** has:\n\n- 5 equal sides\n- 5 equal interior angles\n- All vertices lie on a circle (cyclic polygon)\n- The central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{2\\pi}{5} $ radians\n\nThe **interior angle** of a regular polygon with $ n $ sides is given by the formula:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(n - 2)\\pi}{n}\n$$\n\nFor a pentagon, $ n = 5 $:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(5 - 2)\\pi}{5} = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Interpret the angle at vertex A\n\nWe are asked for the angle **between line AB and line EA at vertex A**.\n\nNote: The problem says “lines AB and AE are adjacent sides of the outer pentagon.” So, at vertex A, the two sides meeting are AB and AE.\n\nIn polygon terminology, the **interior angle at vertex A** is the angle between the two sides meeting at A — that is, between side AB and side AE (or EA, since direction doesn’t matter for angle measure).\n\nThus, the angle between AB and EA at vertex A is **exactly the interior angle** of the regular pentagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm with diagram\n\nAlthough the diagram shows an inner pentagon and some diagonals (like BE), the question is only about the angle at vertex A of the **outer pentagon**, formed by its two adjacent sides AB and AE. The inner pentagon and other points (like O1, F, G, etc.) are red herrings for this particular question — they do not affect the interior angle at vertex A of the outer pentagon.\n\nAlso, note that BE is a diagonal — this is consistent with a regular pentagon, where diagonals connect non-adjacent vertices. But again, this does not affect the angle at A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe interior angle of a regular pentagon is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}}\n$$\n\nThis is the radian measure of the angle between AB and EA at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n✅ **Final Answer: $ \\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}} $**"
