    "We are given a geometric diagram with two congruent squares sharing a common vertex at point **B**:\n\n- Square **ABCD**, centered at **O1**, side length = 7.\n- Square **BEFG**, centered at **O2**, obtained by translating the first square **perpendicularly to side CD** (or equivalently, side AB extended).\n- Point **H** is the intersection of segments **BC** and **EF**.\n- Diagonal **BD** is drawn in square ABCD.\n\n**Question**: What is the **radian value** of the angle between line **AB** and line **DA** at vertex **A**?\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the angle being asked\n\nWe are to find the angle **at vertex A** between lines **AB** and **DA**.\n\nIn square **ABCD**, the vertices are labeled in order — typically **A → B → C → D → A**, forming a square.\n\nSo, at vertex **A**, the two sides meeting are:\n\n- **AB** (from A to B)\n- **AD** (from A to D) — note: the question says “DA”, which is the same line as AD, just opposite direction.\n\nSo, the angle between **AB** and **DA** at point **A** is the **interior angle** of the square at vertex **A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Properties of a square\n\nIn any square:\n\n- All interior angles are **90 degrees**.\n- Since the question asks for the answer in **radians**, we convert 90 degrees to radians.\n\nRecall:\n\n> $ 180^\\circ = \\pi $ radians  \n> So, $ 90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ radians\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm that the angle is unaffected by the second square\n\nThe second square **BEFG** is translated perpendicularly to side CD (or AB extended), and shares vertex **B**. However, the angle at **A** in square **ABCD** is **internal to that square** and is **not affected** by the position or orientation of the second square, as long as square ABCD remains a square.\n\nThe problem states that both squares are **congruent**, and the second is obtained by **translation** — which preserves angles and side lengths. But even if it were rotated, the angle at **A** in square **ABCD** is still defined by its own sides.\n\nThus, the angle between **AB** and **DA** at **A** is simply the interior angle of the square at that vertex.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe angle is $ \\frac{\\pi}{2} $ radians.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n$$"
