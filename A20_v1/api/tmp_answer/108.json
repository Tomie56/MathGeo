    "We are given a geometric construction involving:\n\n- Two **concentric regular pentagons** centered at **O1**, with the **inner pentagon** having **side length 8**.\n- A **triangle centered at O2**, with **one vertex at O1**, and **side length equal to that of the base pentagon (i.e., 8)**.\n- Points **K and L** are **vertices of this triangle**.\n- Point **D** lies on a segment of the **inner pentagon**, and **O1D** is drawn — though this may be a red herring or for context.\n- We are to find the **radian measure of angle ∠K-O1-L**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the triangle centered at O2\n\nThe problem says: “A triangle centered at O2 is then derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1, and its side length equals that of the base pentagon.”\n\nThis is ambiguous, but the most reasonable interpretation is:\n\n> The triangle is **equilateral**, centered at O2, with **side length 8**, and **one of its vertices is at O1**.\n\nSo, we have an **equilateral triangle** with vertices, say, **O1, K, L**, all separated by 8 units, and the **center of the triangle is O2**.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the **center** (centroid, circumcenter, incenter, orthocenter — all coincide) is located at equal distance from all three vertices.\n\nSo, if O1, K, L are the vertices of an equilateral triangle of side 8, then **O2 is the center** of triangle O1KL.\n\nWe are to find **∠K-O1-L**, which is the angle at vertex O1 between points K and L.\n\nBut in an **equilateral triangle**, **all internal angles are 60 degrees**, or **π/3 radians**.\n\nSo, if O1, K, L form an equilateral triangle, then angle ∠K-O1-L is simply the angle at O1, which is **60° = π/3 radians**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Confirm the interpretation\n\nThe problem says: “a triangle centered at O2 is then derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1, and its side length equals that of the base pentagon.”\n\nThis strongly suggests that the triangle has **O1 as one vertex**, and the other two vertices (K and L) are placed such that **all sides are length 8**, and the **center is O2**.\n\nThis is consistent with an equilateral triangle with vertex at O1.\n\nAlso, the diagram shows points K, D, L, O1, O2, and lines connecting them. In particular, O1 is connected to K and L, and O2 is inside triangle KDL or KOL — but since the problem says “triangle centered at O2” with vertex at O1, and K and L are its other vertices, then triangle O1KL is the triangle in question.\n\nThus, **∠K-O1-L** is the angle at O1 in triangle O1KL.\n\nIf triangle O1KL is equilateral, then this angle is **π/3 radians**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Is there any reason to think it’s not equilateral?\n\nThe problem says “its side length equals that of the base pentagon” — meaning each side is 8. So if it’s a triangle with all sides equal to 8, it **must be equilateral**.\n\nAlso, “centered at O2” — in an equilateral triangle, the center is well-defined and equidistant from all vertices.\n\nSo, no ambiguity.\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the radian measure of angle ∠K-O1-L is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
