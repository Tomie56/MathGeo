    "We are given a **regular octagon** centered at point **O1**, with vertices labeled **A through H** in **clockwise order**. Each **side** of the octagon has length **3**. We are asked to find the length of **segment CD**, which connects two **adjacent vertices**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure\n\nIn a **regular octagon**, all sides are equal in length, and all interior angles are equal. The vertices are equally spaced around the center.\n\nThe vertices are labeled consecutively: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H — in **clockwise** order.\n\nSo, **C and D are adjacent vertices** — meaning **CD is a side of the octagon**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use given information\n\nThe problem explicitly states:\n\n> “Each side of the octagon has length 3.”\n\nSince **CD is a side** (connecting two adjacent vertices), its length must be equal to the side length of the octagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nTherefore, the length of **CD** is simply **3**.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$"
