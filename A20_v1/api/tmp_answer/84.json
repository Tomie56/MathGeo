    "We are given a **regular octagon** centered at point **O1**, with vertices labeled **A through H** in **clockwise order**. Each **side** of the octagon has a length of **3 units**. The segment **BC** connects two **adjacent vertices**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure\n\nIn a **regular octagon**, all sides are equal in length, and all interior angles are equal. The vertices are equally spaced around the center.\n\nSince the vertices are labeled **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H** in **clockwise order**, then:\n\n- **A** is connected to **B** and **H**\n- **B** is connected to **A** and **C**\n- **C** is connected to **B** and **D**\n\nTherefore, **segment BC** is a **side** of the octagon — it connects two **adjacent vertices**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use given information\n\nThe problem explicitly states:\n\n> Each side of the octagon has a length of 3 units.\n\nSince **BC** is a side of the octagon (connecting adjacent vertices B and C), its length must be equal to the side length of the octagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\n\nNo complex calculation is needed. The segment **BC** is simply one side of the regular octagon, and the side length is given as **3 units**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{3}\n$$"
