    "We are given a diagram with two concentric regular pentagons: an inner pentagon FGHIJ and an outer pentagon ABCDE, both centered at O1. The vertices A, B, and E of the outer pentagon lie on the outer pentagon (which is ABCDE), and we are to find the measure of angle ∠BAE — that is, the angle at vertex A formed by segments AB and AE — **in radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nWe are told that ABCDE is a **regular pentagon** with side length 4, centered at O1. Since it’s regular, all its internal angles are equal, and all sides are equal. The vertices are labeled in order: A, B, C, D, E, going around the pentagon.\n\nWe are to find angle ∠BAE — the angle at vertex A between points B, A, and E.\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the vertices are equally spaced around a circle (the circumcircle). So, we can think of the pentagon as inscribed in a circle centered at O1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use symmetry and central angles\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nThis is because a full circle is \\(2\\pi\\) radians, and there are 5 equal arcs between the 5 vertices.\n\nSo, the angular separation between adjacent vertices (as seen from the center O1) is \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\).\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Determine the positions of points B, A, and E\n\nAssume the pentagon is labeled in **counter-clockwise** order: A → B → C → D → E → A.\n\nSo, moving from A to B is one step counter-clockwise, and from A to E is one step **clockwise** (since E is the previous vertex before A).\n\nTherefore, the arc from E to A to B spans **two sides** of the pentagon: from E to A (1 step), and A to B (1 step), so total arc from E to B via A is 2 steps.\n\nBut we are interested in the **angle at A**, ∠BAE — the internal angle of the pentagon at vertex A.\n\nWait — this is critical.\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the **internal angle** at each vertex is well-known.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use formula for internal angle of a regular polygon\n\nThe formula for the internal angle of a regular polygon with \\(n\\) sides is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Internal angle} = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{n} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nFor a pentagon, \\(n = 5\\):\n\n\\[\n\\text{Internal angle} = \\frac{(5 - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{5} = \\frac{3\\pi}{5} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nThis is the angle between two adjacent sides meeting at a vertex — for example, at vertex A, the angle between sides AB and AE (since E and B are the two neighbors of A in the pentagon).\n\n✅ So, angle ∠BAE is exactly the internal angle at vertex A of the regular pentagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Confirm with diagram\n\nThe problem says: “vertices A, B, and E belong to the outer pentagon.” Since ABCDE is the outer pentagon, and it’s regular, then yes — A is connected to B and E, and ∠BAE is the internal angle at A.\n\nThe inner pentagon FGHIJ is just there for context (perhaps to confuse or to indicate concentricity), but since we are only asked about angle B-A-E in the outer pentagon, and the outer pentagon is regular, we don’t need any information about the inner pentagon.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}}\n\\]"
