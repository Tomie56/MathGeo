    "In the given figure, two circles intersect at points A and C. The left circle is centered at O1 and passes through the vertices of an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 9. The right circle, centered at O2, is a translation of the left circle to the right. Points A, B, and C lie on the circumference of the left circle, with AB and BC being sides of the equilateral triangle. Determine the length of segment AB."

    "We are given a geometric figure with two intersecting circles. The left circle is centered at $ O_1 $ and passes through the vertices of an equilateral triangle $ ABC $, with side length 9. The right circle, centered at $ O_2 $, is a translation of the left circle to the right. Points $ A $, $ B $, and $ C $ lie on the circumference of the left circle, and $ AB $ and $ BC $ are sides of the equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given information\n\n- Triangle $ ABC $ is **equilateral**.\n- All sides are equal: $ AB = BC = CA = 9 $.\n- All three vertices lie on the **left circle** centered at $ O_1 $.\n- Therefore, the left circle is the **circumcircle** of equilateral triangle $ ABC $.\n- The right circle is a **translation** of the left circle — meaning it has the same radius and shape, just shifted horizontally.\n- The two circles intersect at points $ A $ and $ C $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: The question asks: “Determine the length of segment AB.”\n\nBut wait — the problem **already states** that triangle $ ABC $ is equilateral with side length 9. So, by definition:\n\n> In an equilateral triangle, all sides are equal.\n\nTherefore, $ AB = BC = CA = 9 $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Is there any trick or misdirection?\n\nThe problem mentions the two circles, their centers $ O_1 $ and $ O_2 $, and that the right circle is a translation of the left. It also notes that points $ A $ and $ C $ are intersection points of the two circles.\n\nHowever, **none of this affects the length of AB**, because:\n\n- The triangle $ ABC $ is given to be equilateral with side length 9.\n- The fact that the triangle is inscribed in a circle (the circumcircle) is consistent — every equilateral triangle has a circumcircle.\n- The translation of the circle to form a second circle intersecting at $ A $ and $ C $ is geometrically interesting, but **does not alter the side lengths** of triangle $ ABC $.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nThe length of segment $ AB $ is explicitly given as part of the side length of the equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{9}\n$$"
