    "In the given geometric configuration, triangle ABC (centered at O1) is an equilateral triangle with side length 4. A second equilateral triangle, DEC (centered at O2), is derived by placing one of its vertices at the center O1 of triangle ABC, such that O1 lies on side DE and the radius of triangle DEC equals the circumradius of triangle ABC. A third equilateral triangle, FGH (centered at O3), is obtained by translating triangle DEC horizontally to the right without rotation or scaling. All vertices and centers are labeled as shown in the diagram.\n\nWhat is the length of segment AB?"

    "We are told that **triangle ABC is an equilateral triangle with side length 4**, and we are asked to find the **length of segment AB**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given information\n\nThe problem states:\n\n> “triangle ABC (centered at O1) is an equilateral triangle with side length 4.”\n\nThis directly tells us that **AB = BC = CA = 4**.\n\nThe rest of the problem describes additional triangles (DEC and FGH) and their relationships to triangle ABC, including centers O1, O2, O3, and translations. However, **none of this affects the length of AB**, because:\n\n- Triangle ABC is given as equilateral with side length 4.\n- The question asks for the length of AB — which is **explicitly given** as 4.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Check for trick or misdirection\n\nSometimes problems include extra information to distract or test attention to detail. Here, the description of triangle DEC (with O1 on side DE and radius equal to circumradius of ABC) and triangle FGH (translated version of DEC) may seem relevant, but **they are not needed to answer the question**.\n\nThe question is **not** asking for the length of DE, FG, or any other segment — only **AB**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 4, then:\n\n> **AB = 4**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n$$\n\\boxed{4}\n$$"
