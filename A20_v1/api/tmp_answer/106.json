    "We are given a geometric construction involving a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8. Two derivation steps are performed:\n\n1. An **inscribed regular pentagon** (also centered at O1) is drawn.\n2. A **triangle centered at O2** is derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1 and its side length equals that of the base pentagon (i.e., 8).\n\nThe final figure has 14 labeled points and 13 line segments, with no arcs. Additionally, in the first derivation step, a perpendicular is dropped from point I to line L5, meeting it at foot point F0.\n\nWe are to find the **radian measure of angle ∠K-O1-L**, formed by segments O1K and O1L at vertex O1.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the structure\n\nWe are told the original pentagon is **regular** and centered at O1. In a regular pentagon, the central angle between adjacent vertices is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nThis is because a full circle is \\(2\\pi\\) radians, and a regular pentagon has 5 equal central angles.\n\nNow, the problem mentions an **inscribed regular pentagon** also centered at O1. This likely means a smaller pentagon whose vertices lie on the sides or diagonals of the original pentagon — but since it’s centered at the same point and regular, it’s probably rotated or scaled.\n\nHowever, the key point is: we are to find angle ∠K-O1-L, which is the angle at O1 between points K and L.\n\nWe must determine the positions of K and L relative to O1.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Interpret the labeling and geometry\n\nLooking at the diagram (even though we can’t see it, we infer from the description and labels):\n\n- The outer pentagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E (or similar).\n- The inner pentagon has vertices labeled F, G, H, I, J (or similar).\n- Points K and L are likely vertices of the **derived triangle** centered at O2, with one vertex at O1.\n\nThe problem says: “a triangle centered at O2 is derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1 and its side length equals that of the base pentagon.”\n\nSo, we have an **equilateral triangle** (since it’s a triangle with equal side lengths and “centered” — likely meaning centroid or circumcenter at O2) with one vertex at O1, and side length 8.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, all angles are \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\) radians, and the central angles (from centroid to vertices) are not the same as in a regular polygon — but if it’s centered at O2 and one vertex is at O1, then O2 is the centroid or circumcenter.\n\nBut here’s the key: we are to find angle ∠K-O1-L — that is, the angle at O1 between points K and L.\n\nIf K and L are the **other two vertices** of the equilateral triangle (with O1 being the third vertex), then triangle K-O1-L is equilateral, so angle at O1 is:\n\n\\[\n\\angle K-O1-L = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nWait — but is that correct?\n\nLet’s verify.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, each internal angle is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\). So if O1, K, L are the three vertices of an equilateral triangle, then yes, angle at O1 is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\nBut the problem says: “a triangle centered at O2 is derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1 and its side length equals that of the base pentagon.”\n\nSo the triangle has vertices, say, O1, K, L, and is equilateral with side length 8, and centered at O2.\n\nIn that case, O2 is the centroid (or circumcenter) of triangle O1KL.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the centroid and circumcenter coincide, and the angle at each vertex is still \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\nTherefore, ∠K-O1-L = \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\nBut wait — is there any reason to think K and L are not the other two vertices of the triangle?\n\nThe problem says: “the final figure contains 14 labeled points and 13 line segments, with no arcs.” And mentions points like F0, I, J, etc.\n\nAlso, it says: “In the first derivation step, a perpendicular is dropped from point I to line L5, meeting it at foot point F0.”\n\nThis suggests that point I is from the inner pentagon, and L5 is likely a side of the outer pentagon.\n\nBut for our purpose — angle ∠K-O1-L — we are only concerned with points K, O1, L.\n\nGiven that the triangle is derived with one vertex at O1 and side length 8, and it’s centered at O2, and K and L are likely the other two vertices, then triangle O1KL is equilateral.\n\nThus, angle at O1 is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\nBut let’s double-check: could K and L be something else?\n\nThe problem says: “the final figure contains 14 labeled points and 13 line segments, with no arcs.”\n\nThis suggests a sparse figure — perhaps not all connections are drawn.\n\nBut the angle ∠K-O1-L is explicitly formed by segments O1K and O1L — so K and L are connected to O1.\n\nGiven the derivation: first, inscribed pentagon; second, triangle centered at O2 with vertex at O1.\n\nIt’s very likely that K and L are the other two vertices of that triangle.\n\nMoreover, in a regular pentagon, the central angles are \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{5} \\), but here we are dealing with a triangle derived from it, so the angle at O1 is not necessarily related to the pentagon’s central angle.\n\nUnless... is there a possibility that K and L are vertices of the pentagon?\n\nLooking at the labels: outer pentagon likely has A, B, C, D, E; inner pentagon F, G, H, I, J; then K, L, O1, O2, F0.\n\nSo K and L are probably not pentagon vertices — they are new points from the triangle.\n\nAlso, the triangle is centered at O2, with one vertex at O1 — so the other two vertices are symmetrically placed around O2.\n\nThus, triangle O1KL is equilateral, so angle at O1 is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\nBut let’s consider: is the triangle necessarily equilateral?\n\nThe problem says: “a triangle centered at O2 is derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1 and its side length equals that of the base pentagon.”\n\nIt doesn’t explicitly say “equilateral”, but “side length equals that of the base pentagon” — which has side length 8.\n\nIf it’s a triangle with side length 8, and one vertex at O1, and centered at O2, it’s ambiguous — but in geometric constructions, when we say “a triangle with side length s centered at a point”, it usually implies equilateral.\n\nMoreover, if it were not equilateral, we wouldn’t have enough information to determine the angle.\n\nGiven that the problem asks for a specific numerical answer, and the only logical interpretation is that triangle O1KL is equilateral, we proceed with that.\n\nThus, ∠K-O1-L = \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\nBut wait — let’s think again.\n\nThe problem says: “its side length equals that of the base pentagon.” The base pentagon has side length 8, so the triangle has side length 8.\n\nBut does that mean all sides are 8? Or just one side?\n\nIn standard terminology, if a triangle is said to have “side length 8”, it usually means all sides are 8 — i.e., equilateral.\n\nIf it meant only one side, it would specify.\n\nMoreover, “centered at O2” suggests symmetry — which again points to equilateral.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that triangle O1KL is equilateral with side length 8, and thus angle at O1 is \\( \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\).\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n\\]\n\nThis is the radian measure of angle ∠K-O1-L."
