    "In the given geometric figure, a regular triangle with side length 6 and center O1 is concentrically scaled by a factor of 2 to form a larger triangle. Points M0 and M1 are the midpoints of segments L3 and L2, respectively, where L3 and L2 are corresponding sides of the inner and outer triangles. A line segment M0M1 is drawn connecting these midpoints. Determine the length of segment M0M1."

    "We are given a geometric figure involving two concentric equilateral triangles — an inner one with side length 6 and center O1, and an outer one formed by scaling the inner triangle by a factor of 2 (so side length 12). Points M0 and M1 are midpoints of corresponding sides L3 (inner triangle) and L2 (outer triangle), and we are to find the length of segment M0M1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\n- The inner triangle is regular (equilateral) with side length 6.\n- The outer triangle is a concentric scaling of the inner triangle by factor 2 → side length = 12.\n- Since the triangles are concentric and scaled, their centers coincide at O1.\n- L3 is a side of the inner triangle, L2 is the corresponding side of the outer triangle (i.e., same orientation, same direction from center).\n- M0 = midpoint of L3, M1 = midpoint of L2.\n- We are to find the distance between M0 and M1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use coordinate geometry for clarity\n\nLet’s place the figure on the coordinate plane to compute distances.\n\n#### Place the center O1 at the origin: O1 = (0, 0)\n\nWe can orient the inner triangle with one vertex on the positive y-axis for simplicity.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle centered at the origin, the vertices can be placed at:\n\n- Vertex A: (0, r)\n- Vertex B: (r * sin(120°), r * cos(120°)) = (r * √3/2, -r/2)\n- Vertex C: (r * sin(240°), r * cos(240°)) = (-r * √3/2, -r/2)\n\nBut we need to relate the circumradius r to the side length s.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle with side length s, the **circumradius** R is:\n\n> R = s / √3\n\nWait — actually, the correct formula is:\n\n> R = s / (√3) ? Let’s double-check.\n\nActually, for an equilateral triangle:\n\n- Height h = (√3 / 2) * s\n- Centroid (which coincides with circumcenter in equilateral triangle) is located at 2/3 of the height from a vertex.\n\nSo, circumradius R = (2/3) * h = (2/3) * (√3 / 2) * s = (√3 / 3) * s = s / √3\n\n✅ So, R = s / √3\n\nThus, for inner triangle (s = 6):\n\n> R_inner = 6 / √3 = 2√3\n\nFor outer triangle (s = 12):\n\n> R_outer = 12 / √3 = 4√3\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Place vertices of inner triangle\n\nLet’s place the inner triangle with one vertex at the top (along positive y-axis).\n\nSo, vertices of inner triangle:\n\n- A: (0, R_inner) = (0, 2√3)\n- B: (R_inner * sin(120°), R_inner * cos(120°)) = (2√3 * (√3/2), 2√3 * (-1/2)) = (2√3 * √3/2, -√3) = (3, -√3)\n- C: (R_inner * sin(240°), R_inner * cos(240°)) = (2√3 * (-√3/2), 2√3 * (-1/2)) = (-3, -√3)\n\nCheck side length AB:\n\nA = (0, 2√3), B = (3, -√3)\n\nDistance AB = √[(3 - 0)^2 + (-√3 - 2√3)^2] = √[9 + (-3√3)^2] = √[9 + 27] = √36 = 6 ✅\n\nGood.\n\nNow, corresponding side L3: let’s say L3 is side BC of the inner triangle.\n\nB = (3, -√3), C = (-3, -√3)\n\nSo, midpoint M0 of BC:\n\nM0 = ((3 + (-3))/2, (-√3 + (-√3))/2) = (0, -√3)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Outer triangle — scaled by factor 2\n\nSince it’s concentric and scaled by 2, each vertex is twice as far from O1.\n\nSo, vertices of outer triangle:\n\n- A’ = 2 * A = (0, 4√3)\n- B’ = 2 * B = (6, -2√3)\n- C’ = 2 * C = (-6, -2√3)\n\nCorresponding side L2 = B’C’ (since L3 was BC)\n\nMidpoint M1 of B’C’:\n\nM1 = ((6 + (-6))/2, (-2√3 + (-2√3))/2) = (0, -2√3)\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute distance M0M1\n\nM0 = (0, -√3)\n\nM1 = (0, -2√3)\n\nDistance = |y2 - y1| = |-2√3 - (-√3)| = |-√3| = √3\n\n✅ So, the length of segment M0M1 is √3.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{3}}\n$$"
