    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation. A subsequent vertex-on-center derivation produces a triangle centered at O2, with side length equal to that of the original pentagon.

    "We are given a geometric construction involving two regular pentagons centered at O1, with the inner pentagon inscribed within the outer one via a “circum-inscribe” operation — which we interpret as the inner pentagon being inscribed in the outer one such that its vertices lie on the sides or extensions of the outer pentagon, or perhaps it’s scaled and rotated. Additionally, a triangle centered at O2 is derived via “vertex-on-center” derivation, with side length equal to the pentagon’s side (8). Points K and L lie on the outer and inner pentagons respectively, and both are connected to O1. We are to find the radian measure of angle ∠K-O1-L.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure\n\nWe have:\n\n- Two **regular pentagons**, both centered at **O1**.\n- The **outer pentagon** has side length 8.\n- The **inner pentagon** is inscribed within the outer one — likely rotated and scaled.\n- A **triangle** centered at **O2** (a different center) is derived from the pentagons via “vertex-on-center” — possibly meaning one vertex of the triangle coincides with a vertex of the pentagon and the center O2 is placed accordingly. But since we are only asked about angle ∠K-O1-L, and O2 is not directly involved in that angle, we may not need to use O2 for the calculation — unless it affects the positions of K or L.\n\nHowever, the problem says: “Point K lies on the outer pentagon, point L lies on the inner pentagon, and both are connected to center O1.” So we are to find the angle between two radii from O1 to K and L.\n\nBut — **which K and L?** The diagram labels many points: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, O1, O2.\n\nLooking at the diagram (even though we can’t see it, we must infer from standard constructions and labels):\n\n- The outer pentagon is likely labeled with points A, B, C, D, E (in order).\n- The inner pentagon is labeled with points F, G, H, I, J (in order).\n- Points K and L are additional points — K is connected to D and E (from diagram description), and L is connected to E and perhaps another point.\n\nBut crucially, the problem says: “Point K lies on the outer pentagon, point L lies on the inner pentagon, and both are connected to center O1.”\n\nSo we assume K and L are vertices (or points) on the outer and inner pentagons respectively, and we are to find the angle between vectors O1K and O1L.\n\nIn regular pentagons centered at O1, the angular separation between adjacent vertices is 2π/5 radians (72°).\n\nBut since the inner pentagon is inscribed within the outer one, and both are regular and centered at O1, the inner pentagon is likely rotated relative to the outer one.\n\nIn many such constructions (e.g., pentagram or nested pentagons), the inner pentagon is rotated by 36° (π/5 radians) relative to the outer one.\n\nWhy 36°? Because in a regular pentagon, the angle between a vertex and the next vertex is 72°, and the angle between a vertex and the midpoint of the next side (or the “inscribed” vertex) is often 36°.\n\nMoreover, in a regular pentagon, if you connect every other vertex, you get a pentagram, and the inner pentagon formed by the intersections is rotated by 36° relative to the outer one.\n\nSo, if K is a vertex of the outer pentagon, and L is the corresponding “inscribed” vertex of the inner pentagon, then the angle between them (as seen from O1) is likely **36°**, or **π/5 radians**.\n\nBut let’s verify this with geometry.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use properties of regular pentagons\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the central angle between two adjacent vertices is:\n\n> θ = 2π / 5 = 72° = 1.2566... radians\n\nIf the inner pentagon is inscribed such that its vertices lie on the sides of the outer pentagon (as in a typical “inscribed pentagon” construction), then each vertex of the inner pentagon lies at the intersection of diagonals of the outer pentagon.\n\nIn such a case, the inner pentagon is rotated by **36°** relative to the outer pentagon.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause in a regular pentagon, the angle between a vertex and the next diagonal intersection (which becomes a vertex of the inner pentagon) is half of 72°, i.e., 36°.\n\nAlternatively, consider the symmetry: the full rotation is 360°, and the pentagon has 5-fold symmetry. The inner pentagon, being inscribed and regular, must also have 5-fold symmetry, so the angular offset must be a multiple of 72°/2 = 36°.\n\nIn fact, in the standard pentagram construction, the inner pentagon is rotated by 36° relative to the outer one.\n\nThus, if K is a vertex of the outer pentagon, and L is the “corresponding” vertex of the inner pentagon (i.e., the one that lies “between” two vertices of the outer pentagon), then the angle ∠K-O1-L is **36°**, or **π/5 radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm with diagram labels (inferred)\n\nFrom the diagram description:\n\n- Points A, B, C, D, E are likely the outer pentagon vertices.\n- Points F, G, H, I, J are the inner pentagon vertices.\n- Point K is connected to D and E — so K is likely vertex D or E? But the problem says K is on the outer pentagon — so perhaps K is D or E.\n- Point L is connected to E and perhaps another point — and lies on the inner pentagon.\n\nBut more importantly, the problem says “both are connected to center O1”, so we are to find the angle between O1K and O1L.\n\nAssuming the inner pentagon is rotated by 36° relative to the outer one, and if K and L are “corresponding” points (e.g., K is vertex A of outer, L is vertex F of inner, which is rotated 36° from A), then the angle is 36°.\n\nBut to be precise, let’s assume that the inner pentagon is rotated by 36° relative to the outer one. Then, for any vertex K of the outer pentagon, the nearest vertex L of the inner pentagon is at an angular separation of 36°.\n\nHence, ∠K-O1-L = 36° = π/5 radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Consider the triangle centered at O2\n\nThe problem mentions a triangle centered at O2, derived via “vertex-on-center” derivation, with side length 8. But since we are only asked about angle ∠K-O1-L, and O2 is not involved in that angle, we can ignore it for this calculation — unless it affects the positions of K or L.\n\nBut the problem says: “Point K lies on the outer pentagon, point L lies on the inner pentagon, and both are connected to center O1.” So O2 is irrelevant for this angle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final answer\n\nTherefore, the radian measure of angle ∠K-O1-L is:\n\n> **π/5 radians**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{5}}$"
