    "In the given geometric figure, triangle ABC is inscribed within a larger triangle DEF such that both share the same center O1 and are concentric. Triangle ABC is a regular triangle with side length 6, and triangle DEF is a scaled version of ABC by a factor of 2. Point A is a vertex common to both triangles, and segments AB and AC are sides of the inner triangle ABC. Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by line AB and line CA at vertex A."

    "We are given a geometric figure with two concentric triangles: an inner triangle ABC and an outer triangle DEF. Triangle ABC is **regular** (i.e., equilateral) with side length 6. Triangle DEF is a **scaled version** of ABC by a factor of 2, and both share the same center O1. Point A is a **common vertex** of both triangles.\n\nWe are asked to find the **radian measure of the angle formed by line AB and line CA at vertex A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the angle in question\n\nThe angle formed by line AB and line CA at vertex A is the **angle at vertex A of triangle ABC**, which is ∠BAC.\n\nSince triangle ABC is **regular (equilateral)**, all its internal angles are equal.\n\nIn any equilateral triangle, each internal angle is:\n\n> **60 degrees**\n\nWe are asked to express this angle in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Convert degrees to radians\n\nThe conversion formula from degrees to radians is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{radians} = \\text{degrees} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n60^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify relevance of other information\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n- Triangle DEF is a scaled version of ABC by factor 2 → this affects size, not angles.\n- Both triangles are concentric and share center O1 → this affects position, not the internal angles of ABC.\n- Point A is common to both → this is just to anchor the figure, but doesn’t change the angle at A in triangle ABC.\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral, its internal angles are **independent** of scaling or concentricity — they are always 60°.\n\nThus, the angle ∠BAC is **always** 60°, or **π/3 radians**, regardless of the outer triangle.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n\\]"
