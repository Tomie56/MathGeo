    "We are given a geometric figure involving two concentric equilateral triangles: an inner triangle ABC and an outer triangle DEF, both centered at point O1, and sharing vertex A. The inner triangle has side length 6, and the outer triangle is a scaled version by a factor of 2. Point F0 lies on segment BC such that AF0 is perpendicular to BC.\n\nThe question asks for the **radian value of the angle between line AB and line CA at vertex A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\nWe are told that triangle ABC is a **regular triangle** (i.e., equilateral triangle) with side length 6, centered at O1. Since it’s equilateral, all internal angles are 60 degrees (or π/3 radians).\n\nThe angle between line AB and line CA at vertex A is simply the **internal angle at vertex A of triangle ABC**.\n\nIn any triangle, the angle at a vertex is formed by the two sides meeting at that vertex. So, at vertex A, the two sides are AB and AC (note: CA is the same line as AC, just in reverse direction).\n\nTherefore, the angle between AB and CA at A is the angle ∠BAC.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use properties of equilateral triangle\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, all angles are equal and each measures:\n\n> 60 degrees = π/3 radians\n\nThis is a standard geometric fact.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm that scaling and concentricity do not affect the internal angle\n\nThe outer triangle DEF is a scaled version of ABC by factor 2, centered at O1, and they share vertex A. However, **scaling does not change angles** — it only changes side lengths proportionally. So, even though DEF is larger, the internal angles of ABC remain unchanged.\n\nAlso, the fact that F0 lies on BC and AF0 is perpendicular to BC is **irrelevant** to the angle at A between AB and CA. That information might be a red herring or intended for a different part of a larger problem, but for this specific question, it is not needed.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThe angle between AB and CA at vertex A is the internal angle of the equilateral triangle at A, which is:\n\n> **π/3 radians**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n$\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{3}}$"
