    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two concentric equilateral triangles: an inner triangle ABC and an outer triangle DEF, both centered at point O1, and both sharing vertex A. The inner triangle ABC has side length 6, and the outer triangle DEF is a scaled version of ABC by a factor of 2, centered at O1. Point F0 lies on segment BC such that AF0 is perpendicular to BC. We are to find the **radian measure of angle BAC**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\nWe are told that triangle ABC is a **regular triangle** (i.e., equilateral) with side length 6, centered at O1. Since it’s equilateral and centered at O1, O1 is the **centroid**, **incenter**, **circumcenter**, and **orthocenter** — all coincide in an equilateral triangle.\n\nTriangle DEF is a **concentric scaling** of ABC by factor 2, meaning it’s also equilateral, centered at O1, and each side is twice as long (so side length 12). Both triangles share vertex A — this is critical.\n\nSince both triangles are equilateral and concentric, and share vertex A, the scaling must be such that point A lies on the same ray from O1 in both triangles. That is, the scaling is radial from O1, and A is fixed? Wait — that can’t be unless A is at O1, which it isn’t.\n\nActually, if you scale a triangle concentrically by factor 2, every point moves radially away from the center by factor 2. So if triangle ABC is scaled to DEF with center O1, then:\n\n- D is the image of A under scaling by 2 from O1\n- E is the image of B\n- F is the image of C\n\nBut the problem says: “both sharing vertex A”. That implies that point A is **fixed** under the scaling — which only happens if A is the center O1. But that contradicts the fact that O1 is the center of the triangle ABC, and A is a vertex.\n\nSo there’s an inconsistency unless we reinterpret.\n\nWait — perhaps the problem means that **both triangles share vertex A**, but the scaling is such that A is mapped to itself? That would require A to lie on the center O1 — again impossible unless A = O1.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that **vertex A of the inner triangle is the same point as vertex A of the outer triangle** — but under scaling from O1, that would mean A is invariant under scaling by 2, which again implies A = O1.\n\nThis is a contradiction unless we reinterpret the problem.\n\nLet’s read again:\n\n> “a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 6 is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2, resulting in an outer triangle DEF and an inner triangle ABC, both sharing vertex A and center O1.”\n\nThis is ambiguous. But perhaps it means:\n\n- There is an inner equilateral triangle ABC, side length 6, centered at O1.\n- It is scaled by factor 2 about O1 to produce a larger equilateral triangle DEF.\n- The two triangles share vertex A — meaning that point A is a vertex of both triangles.\n\nBut under scaling by 2 about O1, if A is a vertex of the inner triangle, then its image under scaling would be a point D = 2*(A - O1) + O1 = 2A - O1, which is different from A unless A = O1.\n\nSo the only way A is shared is if the scaling maps A to A — which requires A = O1 — impossible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem means that **the outer triangle is DEF, the inner is ABC, and they share vertex A**, meaning that A is a vertex of both — but that can only happen if the scaling is not from O1? But the problem says “concentrically”.\n\nWait — perhaps “both sharing vertex A” means that A is a vertex of the inner triangle, and the outer triangle has a vertex that coincides with A? That still doesn’t make sense under scaling.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem has a typo, and it’s meant to say that the triangles are concentric and similar, and point A is a vertex of the inner triangle, and we are to find angle BAC — which, since ABC is equilateral, is 60 degrees.\n\nWait — that’s a key point.\n\n### Step 2: Re-express the core question\n\nRegardless of the scaling and the outer triangle DEF, the question is:\n\n> Determine the radian measure of angle BAC.\n\nAnd we are told that triangle ABC is a **regular triangle** (equilateral) with side length 6.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, **all interior angles are 60 degrees**.\n\nSo angle BAC = 60°.\n\nConvert to radians:\n\n60° = π/3 radians.\n\nThe rest of the information — about scaling, outer triangle DEF, point F0, AF0 perpendicular to BC — may be **red herrings**, or perhaps meant to distract, or perhaps to confirm that ABC is equilateral.\n\nBut let’s verify if the configuration is consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Check if the perpendicular from A to BC is relevant\n\nWe are told: “Point F0 lies on segment BC such that AF0 is perpendicular to BC.”\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the perpendicular from a vertex to the opposite side is also the median and the angle bisector. So F0 would be the midpoint of BC.\n\nThis is consistent with equilateral triangle properties.\n\nSo nothing contradicts ABC being equilateral.\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral, angle BAC = 60° = π/3 radians.\n\nThe scaling to DEF and the point F0 are not needed to compute angle BAC — they may be included to test if the solver gets distracted.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
