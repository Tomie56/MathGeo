    "We are given a geometric construction involving two regular pentagons centered at O1, with the inner pentagon inscribed within the outer one via a “circum-inscribe” operation — which we interpret as meaning the inner pentagon is inscribed in the outer one such that its vertices lie on the sides or at specific symmetric positions relative to the outer pentagon. Additionally, a triangle centered at O2 (with side length equal to the pentagon’s side, 8) is placed such that one of its vertices is at O1. Points K and L are vertices of the inner and outer pentagons respectively, and we are to find the angle ∠KO1L in radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the symmetry of regular pentagons\n\nA regular pentagon has rotational symmetry of 72° (or 2π/5 radians) between adjacent vertices. That is, the central angle between any two adjacent vertices (as seen from the center) is 2π/5.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- The outer pentagon: vertices A, B, C, D, E (in order, say clockwise).\n- The inner pentagon: vertices F, G, H, I, K (in order, also clockwise), inscribed within the outer one, centered at O1.\n\nSince both pentagons are regular and concentric (same center O1), and the inner one is inscribed in the outer one, the most natural interpretation is that the inner pentagon is rotated relative to the outer one, and its vertices lie on the sides or diagonals of the outer pentagon — but for angle calculation, we only need the angular positions of K and L relative to O1.\n\nWe are told:\n\n- K is a vertex of the inner pentagon.\n- L is a vertex of the outer pentagon.\n- We are to find ∠KO1L — the angle at O1 between points K, O1, L.\n\nThis is the angle between the two vectors O1K and O1L.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Assign angular positions\n\nAssume the outer pentagon is oriented with one vertex (say, point A) along the positive x-axis. Then the angular positions (in radians) of the outer pentagon’s vertices, measured counterclockwise from the positive x-axis, are:\n\n- A: 0\n- B: 2π/5\n- C: 4π/5\n- D: 6π/5\n- E: 8π/5\n\nSimilarly, the inner pentagon is also regular and centered at O1. But it is “inscribed” within the outer one. In many such constructions, the inner pentagon is rotated by half the central angle — i.e., by π/5 — relative to the outer one. This is common in star pentagons or nested pentagons.\n\nSo, if the outer pentagon has vertices at angles 0, 2π/5, 4π/5, 6π/5, 8π/5, then the inner pentagon might be rotated by π/5, so its vertices are at:\n\n- F: π/5\n- G: 3π/5\n- H: 5π/5 = π\n- I: 7π/5\n- K: 9π/5\n\n(Note: 9π/5 is equivalent to -π/5 modulo 2π, but we’ll keep it as 9π/5 for consistency.)\n\nNow, we are told that K is a vertex of the inner pentagon — so let’s assign K to be at angle 9π/5.\n\nL is a vertex of the outer pentagon. The problem doesn’t specify which one, but since we are to compute ∠KO1L, and no specific positions are given, we must assume the minimal or most symmetric configuration — likely, L is the vertex of the outer pentagon that is “closest” to K in angular position, or perhaps directly aligned in some symmetric way.\n\nBut wait — the problem says: “Line segments O1K and LO1 are drawn.” So L is a vertex of the outer pentagon, and we are to find the angle between O1K and O1L.\n\nSince both pentagons are regular and concentric, and the inner one is inscribed in the outer one, the angular separation between corresponding vertices is constant.\n\nIn a standard concentric inscribed regular pentagon, the inner pentagon is often rotated by π/5 relative to the outer one. So if we pick K as a vertex of the inner pentagon at angle θ, then the nearest outer pentagon vertex would be at θ ± π/5.\n\nLet’s suppose:\n\n- Let K be at angle 9π/5 (inner pentagon vertex).\n- Then the nearest outer pentagon vertex would be at 8π/5 (vertex E) or 0 (vertex A).\n\nCompute angular differences:\n\n- From K at 9π/5 to E at 8π/5: difference = |9π/5 - 8π/5| = π/5\n- From K at 9π/5 to A at 0: difference = |9π/5 - 0| = 9π/5, but since angles are modulo 2π, 9π/5 - 2π = -π/5 → absolute value π/5.\n\nSo both E and A are π/5 away from K.\n\nTherefore, if L is either E or A, then ∠KO1L = π/5.\n\nBut is this the only possibility? The problem doesn’t specify which vertex L is — but since it’s asking for “the” angle ∠KO1L, and given the symmetry, it’s implied that we are to find the angle between a vertex of the inner pentagon and the nearest vertex of the outer pentagon — which is π/5.\n\nBut wait — let’s double-check the construction.\n\nThe problem says: “a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation.”\n\n“Circum-inscribe” is not a standard term, but likely means that the inner pentagon is inscribed in the outer one — i.e., its vertices lie on the sides of the outer pentagon. In that case, the angular offset between inner and outer pentagon vertices is typically π/5.\n\nMoreover, in a regular pentagon, if you inscribe another regular pentagon by connecting points that divide the sides in the golden ratio, the resulting inner pentagon is rotated by 36° = π/5 relative to the outer one.\n\nThus, the angular separation between a vertex of the inner pentagon and the nearest vertex of the outer pentagon is π/5 radians.\n\nTherefore, ∠KO1L = π/5.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Consider the triangle centered at O2\n\nThe problem also mentions: “A second derivation places a triangle centered at O2, with side length equal to that of the base pentagon, such that one of its vertices lies at O1.”\n\nThis seems like a red herring — or perhaps it’s meant to distract. The triangle is centered at O2, has side length 8, and one vertex is at O1. But we are to find ∠KO1L, which involves only points K, O1, L — all related to the pentagons centered at O1.\n\nThe triangle centered at O2 doesn’t appear to affect the positions of K or L or the angle at O1. Unless O2 is used to define the position of K or L — but the problem says K is a vertex of the inner pentagon, L is a vertex of the outer pentagon — both centered at O1.\n\nTherefore, the triangle centered at O2 is likely irrelevant to the angle ∠KO1L.\n\nPerhaps it’s included to test if we get distracted — but logically, since K and L are defined as vertices of the pentagons centered at O1, and the angle is at O1, the triangle at O2 doesn’t influence this angle.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThus, the angle ∠KO1L is the angular separation between a vertex of the inner pentagon and the nearest vertex of the outer pentagon, which is π/5 radians.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\boxed{\\dfrac{\\pi}{5}}"
