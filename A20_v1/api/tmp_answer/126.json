    "We are given a regular octagon inscribed in a circle centered at O1, with side length 10. A triangle I-J-O2 is constructed such that O2 is its center and its side length equals that of the octagon (i.e., 10). Points M0 and M1 are midpoints of sides GH and BC of the octagon, respectively, and are connected by a line segment. We are to find the measure of angle ∠I-O1-J in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the regular octagon\n\nA regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal central angles. Since it is inscribed in a circle centered at O1, each central angle (angle between two adjacent vertices from the center) is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nSo, the angular separation between any two adjacent vertices (like A and B, B and C, etc.) as seen from O1 is π/4 radians.\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Locate points I and J\n\nThe problem says: “A triangle I-J-O2 is constructed such that O2 is its center and its side length equals that of the octagon.”\n\nThis is ambiguous at first, but note that O2 is labeled as the “center” of triangle I-J-O2 — which is unusual, since a triangle has multiple centers (centroid, circumcenter, incenter, etc.). However, since the triangle is equilateral (all sides equal to 10, as side length equals that of the octagon), and O2 is called “its center”, it is most reasonable to interpret O2 as the **circumcenter** (which for an equilateral triangle coincides with centroid, incenter, etc.).\n\nBut more importantly, we are to find angle ∠I-O1-J — that is, the angle at O1 between points I and J.\n\nSo we must determine the positions of I and J relative to O1.\n\nLooking at the diagram (even though we can’t see it, we can infer from labels and context):\n\n- The octagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H in order around the circle.\n- M1 is the midpoint of BC, M0 is the midpoint of GH.\n- Triangle I-J-O2 is drawn inside the octagon, with O2 near the center but slightly offset? But the problem says O2 is the center of the triangle, not necessarily of the octagon.\n\nHowever, the key is: **we are to find angle I-O1-J**, i.e., the angle at O1 between points I and J.\n\nSo we need to know the angular positions of I and J with respect to O1.\n\nBut the problem does **not** specify where I and J are located on the octagon or relative to it — except that triangle I-J-O2 has side length 10 and O2 is its center.\n\nThis suggests that I and J are **vertices of the octagon** — because otherwise, we have no way to relate them to O1.\n\nWait — let’s look again at the diagram description:\n\n> Points M0 and M1 are the midpoints of sides GH and BC of the octagon, respectively, and are connected by a line segment.\n\nThis line segment M0-M1 may be relevant, but the question is about angle I-O1-J.\n\nAlso, in the diagram, points I and J are connected to O1, and O2 is inside triangle I-J-O2.\n\nBut here’s a critical observation:\n\nIn a regular octagon, if we pick two vertices that are **three sides apart**, the central angle between them is 3 × π/4 = 3π/4.\n\nIf we pick two vertices that are **two sides apart**, it’s 2 × π/4 = π/2.\n\nBut we need to figure out which vertices I and J are.\n\nLooking at the diagram labels (from the image description):\n\nThe octagon vertices are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H in order.\n\nPoints I and J are inside the octagon, connected to O1, and form a triangle with O2.\n\nBut here’s a key insight:\n\nIn many such problems, when a triangle is constructed with side length equal to the octagon’s side and centered at O2, and I and J are connected to O1, it’s often the case that I and J are **vertices of the octagon** that are symmetrically placed with respect to the center.\n\nMoreover, in the diagram, point I is near E and D, and J is near F and G — perhaps I is vertex E and J is vertex G? Or D and F?\n\nWait — let’s count the steps.\n\nSuppose the octagon vertices are labeled clockwise: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H.\n\nThen:\n\n- From A to B: 1 step → π/4\n- A to C: 2 steps → π/2\n- A to D: 3 steps → 3π/4\n- A to E: 4 steps → π\n- A to F: 5 steps → 5π/4\n- etc.\n\nNow, in the diagram, point I is near E, and J is near F — but also, O2 is near the center, and triangle I-J-O2 is equilateral.\n\nBut if I and J are vertices of the octagon, and the side length of the triangle is 10 (same as octagon side), then the distance between I and J must be 10.\n\nIn a regular octagon with side length s, the distance between two vertices separated by k steps is:\n\n\\[\nd_k = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{8}\\right)\n\\]\n\nwhere R is the circumradius.\n\nBut we are told the side length is 10, so for adjacent vertices (k=1):\n\n\\[\n10 = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\n\\Rightarrow R = \\frac{10}{2 \\sin(\\pi/8)} = \\frac{5}{\\sin(\\pi/8)}\n\\]\n\nBut we may not need R.\n\nNow, if I and J are two vertices of the octagon such that the chord IJ = 10, then they must be adjacent vertices — because in a regular octagon, only adjacent vertices are distance 10 apart. All other chords are longer.\n\nWait — is that true?\n\nLet’s compute chord lengths for a regular octagon with side length 10.\n\nThe chord length between two vertices separated by k steps is:\n\n\\[\nd_k = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{k\\pi}{8}\\right)\n\\]\n\nBut since for k=1, d_1 = 10, we have:\n\n\\[\n10 = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\n\\Rightarrow R = \\frac{5}{\\sin(\\pi/8)}\n\\]\n\nThen for k=2:\n\n\\[\nd_2 = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{2\\pi}{8}\\right) = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{4}\\right) = 2R \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2} = R\\sqrt{2}\n= \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{\\sin(\\pi/8)}\n\\]\n\nNow, sin(π/8) = sin(22.5°) = √[(1 - cos(45°))/2] = √[(1 - √2/2)/2] = √[ (2 - √2)/4 ] = √(2 - √2)/2\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nd_2 = \\frac{5\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}/2} = \\frac{10\\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]\n\nThis is clearly greater than 10.\n\nSimilarly, d_3 > d_2 > 10.\n\nSo only adjacent vertices are distance 10 apart.\n\nTherefore, if triangle I-J-O2 has side length 10, and I and J are vertices of the octagon, then I and J must be **adjacent vertices**.\n\nBut then the triangle I-J-O2 would have IJ = 10, and IO2 = JO2 = 10, so it’s equilateral.\n\nBut can O2 be the center of this equilateral triangle and also lie inside the octagon?\n\nPossibly, but then what is the angle ∠I-O1-J?\n\nIf I and J are adjacent vertices of the octagon, then the central angle ∠I-O1-J is simply the central angle between two adjacent vertices, which is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n\\]\n\nBut is that the answer? Let’s verify.\n\nThe problem says: “A triangle I-J-O2 is constructed such that O2 is its center and its side length equals that of the octagon.”\n\nIf I and J are adjacent vertices, and O2 is the center of the equilateral triangle I-J-O2, then O2 is located such that it forms an equilateral triangle with I and J.\n\nIn that case, O2 is not the center of the octagon — it’s offset.\n\nBut the question is not about O2 — it’s about angle I-O1-J.\n\nAnd if I and J are adjacent vertices of the octagon, then regardless of where O2 is, the angle at O1 between I and J is π/4 radians.\n\nBut"
