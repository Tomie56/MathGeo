    "In the given geometric construction, two circles intersect at points A and C, with centers O₁ and O₂ respectively. A regular triangle with side length 9 and center O₁ is inscribed in the first circle. Point B lies on the circumference of the first circle. A perpendicular is drawn from point B to the line segment O₁O₂, meeting it at foot point F₀. Given that the triangle is rotated by π/3 radians and the second circle is a translation of the first to the right, find the radian measure of angle BAC."
