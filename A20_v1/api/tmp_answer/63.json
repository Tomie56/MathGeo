    "Two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, are positioned such that square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD perpendicularly to side CD, with point H coinciding with point C.

    "We are given two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, each with side length 7 units. Square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD **perpendicularly to side CD**, such that point **H coincides with point C**.\n\nWe are asked to find the measure of **angle BAD in radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry of square ABCD\n\nIn any square, all interior angles are **right angles**, i.e., **90 degrees** or **π/2 radians**.\n\nAngle BAD is the angle at vertex A between points B, A, and D.\n\nIn square ABCD, the vertices are typically labeled in order, either clockwise or counterclockwise. Assuming standard labeling:\n\n- A → B → C → D → A (clockwise or counterclockwise)\n\nThen, angle BAD is the angle at vertex A between sides AB and AD.\n\nIn a square, adjacent sides are perpendicular. So, angle between AB and AD is **90 degrees**, regardless of the position or orientation of the square — as long as it is a square.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Consider the translation and position of EFGH\n\nThe problem states that square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD **perpendicularly to side CD**, such that **H coincides with C**.\n\nThis tells us about the relative position of the two squares, but **does not affect the internal angles of square ABCD**.\n\nAngle BAD is an **internal angle of square ABCD**, and since ABCD is a square, angle BAD is **always 90 degrees**, or **π/2 radians**, regardless of how the square is moved or rotated — as long as it remains a square.\n\nThe translation and the position of EFGH are **red herrings** for this particular question — they are given to possibly distract or to set up a more complex problem, but **angle BAD is purely a property of square ABCD**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Convert degrees to radians\n\nWe know:\n\n> 90 degrees = π/2 radians\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n$$"
