    "We are given that triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in a circle centered at $O_1$, and that $AB = BC = CA = 7$. This means triangle $ABC$ is **equilateral** with side length 7.\n\nFrom vertex $A$, a perpendicular is drawn to side $BC$, meeting it at point $F_0$. We are to find the length of segment $AF_0$.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle**, the perpendicular from a vertex to the opposite side is also the **altitude**, **median**, and **angle bisector**. So, point $F_0$ is the **midpoint** of side $BC$.\n\nThus, we are being asked to find the **altitude** of an equilateral triangle with side length 7.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the formula for the altitude of an equilateral triangle\n\nFor an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the altitude $h$ is given by:\n\n$$\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s\n$$\n\nSubstitute $s = 7$:\n\n$$\nAF_0 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 7 = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify using Pythagoras (optional)\n\nIn triangle $ABF_0$, since $F_0$ is the midpoint of $BC$, we have:\n\n- $BF_0 = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5$\n- $AB = 7$\n- $AF_0$ is perpendicular to $BC$, so triangle $ABF_0$ is a right triangle with right angle at $F_0$.\n\nBy the Pythagorean theorem:\n\n$$\nAF_0^2 + BF_0^2 = AB^2\n$$\n$$\nAF_0^2 + \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2 = 7^2\n$$\n$$\nAF_0^2 + \\frac{49}{4} = 49\n$$\n$$\nAF_0^2 = 49 - \\frac{49}{4} = \\frac{196}{4} - \\frac{49}{4} = \\frac{147}{4}\n$$\n$$\nAF_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{147}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{147}}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{49 \\cdot 3}}{2} = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n$$\n\nSame result.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\n$$"
