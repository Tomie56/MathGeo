    "We are given two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, each with side length 7. Square EFGH is translated perpendicularly from square ABCD along the direction of side CD (or GH), and they share vertex H with vertex C. The centers are labeled O1 (for ABCD) and O2 (for EFGH).\n\nHowever, the **question asks**:\n\n> Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by line segments AB and DA at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the angle at vertex A\n\nIn square ABCD, the vertices are labeled in order — typically, in a clockwise or counterclockwise manner. Assuming standard labeling:\n\n- A → B → C → D → A\n\nThen, at vertex A, the two sides meeting are:\n\n- Segment AB (from A to B)\n- Segment AD (from A to D) — note: the question says “DA”, which is the same line segment as AD, just in reverse direction.\n\nSo, the angle formed by AB and DA at vertex A is the **interior angle** of the square at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Properties of a square\n\nIn any square:\n\n- All interior angles are **right angles**, i.e., **90 degrees**.\n- 90 degrees in radians is:\n\n\\[\n90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Relevance of the second square?\n\nThe problem mentions square EFGH and its position relative to ABCD, and the centers O1 and O2. However, the question is **only** asking for the angle at vertex A between segments AB and DA — which are **entirely within square ABCD**.\n\nThe position or translation of square EFGH does **not affect** the internal angle at vertex A of square ABCD. Since the squares are congruent and rigid, and no deformation is mentioned, the angle at A remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThus, the radian measure of the angle formed by AB and DA at vertex A is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n\\]"
