    "We are given that triangle $ABC$ is inscribed in a circle centered at $O_1$, and that all sides are equal: $AB = BC = CA = 7$. This means triangle $ABC$ is **equilateral**.\n\nWe are to find the length of segment $AF_0$, where $F_0$ is the **foot of the perpendicular** from vertex $A$ to side $BC$. In other words, $AF_0$ is the **altitude** from vertex $A$ to side $BC$ in equilateral triangle $ABC$.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Use properties of an equilateral triangle\n\nIn an equilateral triangle with side length $s$, the altitude $h$ can be calculated using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nConsider triangle $ABC$, with $BC$ as the base. Drop a perpendicular from $A$ to $BC$, meeting at point $F_0$. Since the triangle is equilateral, this perpendicular also bisects $BC$ (it is also the median and angle bisector).\n\nSo, $BF_0 = F_0C = \\frac{7}{2} = 3.5$.\n\nNow, consider right triangle $AF_0B$ (or $AF_0C$), with:\n\n- Hypotenuse $AB = 7$\n- One leg $BF_0 = 3.5$\n- Other leg $AF_0 = h$ (the altitude we want to find)\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Apply the Pythagorean Theorem\n\nIn right triangle $AF_0B$:\n\n$$\nAB^2 = AF_0^2 + BF_0^2\n$$\n\nSubstitute known values:\n\n$$\n7^2 = h^2 + \\left(\\frac{7}{2}\\right)^2\n$$\n\n$$\n49 = h^2 + \\frac{49}{4}\n$$\n\nSubtract $\\frac{49}{4}$ from both sides:\n\n$$\nh^2 = 49 - \\frac{49}{4} = \\frac{196}{4} - \\frac{49}{4} = \\frac{147}{4}\n$$\n\nTake square root:\n\n$$\nh = \\sqrt{\\frac{147}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{147}}{2}\n$$\n\nSimplify $\\sqrt{147}$:\n\n$$\n\\sqrt{147} = \\sqrt{49 \\cdot 3} = 7\\sqrt{3}\n$$\n\nSo,\n\n$$\nh = \\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{7\\sqrt{3}}{2}}\n$$\n\nThis is the length of segment $AF_0$."
