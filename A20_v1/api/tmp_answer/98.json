    "In the given diagram, a regular pentagon ABCDE with center O1 and side length 4 is inscribed within another regular pentagon FGHJI, also centered at O1.

    "We are given a diagram with two concentric regular pentagons: the outer pentagon is labeled **FGHJI**, and the inner pentagon is **ABCDE**, both centered at **O1**. We are told that **ABCDE** is a regular pentagon with side length 4, and we are to find the **radian measure of angle BAE**, which is the internal angle at vertex **A** of pentagon **ABCDE**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nThe key point is that **ABCDE** is a **regular pentagon**. In a regular pentagon, **all internal angles are equal**, and we can compute the measure of any internal angle using a standard formula.\n\nThe problem mentions point **F0** and perpendicularity, but **angle BAE** is entirely within pentagon **ABCDE**, and does not involve any points from the outer pentagon **FGHJI** or point **F0**. Therefore, the information about the outer pentagon and point F0 is **irrelevant** to computing angle BAE.\n\nWe can ignore the outer pentagon and point F0 for this specific question.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Formula for internal angle of a regular polygon\n\nFor any regular **n**-gon, the measure of each **internal angle** is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{n} \\quad \\text{(in radians)}\n\\]\n\nFor a pentagon, **n = 5**.\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{(5 - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{5} = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm that angle BAE is an internal angle\n\nIn pentagon **ABCDE**, the vertices are labeled in order: A → B → C → D → E → A.\n\nAngle **BAE** is the angle at vertex **A**, formed by sides **AB** and **AE**.\n\nIn a polygon, the internal angle at a vertex is formed by the two adjacent sides meeting at that vertex.\n\nAt vertex **A**, the two adjacent sides are **AB** and **AE** (since the pentagon is cyclic: E → A → B).\n\nTherefore, **angle BAE is indeed the internal angle at vertex A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nThus, the radian measure of angle BAE is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n✅ **Note**: The side length (4) is not needed to compute the internal angle, since all regular pentagons have the same internal angles regardless of size. The center O1 and the outer pentagon are red herrings for this specific question.\n\n---\n\n**Final Answer:**\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}}\n\\]"
