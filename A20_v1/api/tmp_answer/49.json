    "We are given two **congruent squares**, ABCD and EFGH, each with side length **7 units**.\n\nSquare EFGH is obtained by **translating** square ABCD **perpendicularly to side CD**. This means the translation vector is perpendicular to side CD — i.e., in the direction **normal to CD**.\n\nAlso, we are told:\n\n- Point **E lies on side BC** of square ABCD.\n- Point **H lies on side CD** of square ABCD.\n- O1 and O2 are centers of squares ABCD and EFGH, respectively.\n\nWe are to find the **length of segment EF**.\n\n---\n\nBut wait — **EF is a side of square EFGH**, and since EFGH is a square with side length 7, then **EF = 7**.\n\nIs that it? That seems too straightforward. Let’s double-check the problem.\n\n> “Find the length of segment EF.”\n\nEF is a side of square EFGH. The problem says both squares are **congruent** and have side length **7 units**. So unless EF is not a side (which it is — EFGH is a square, so EF is a side), then EF = 7.\n\nBut perhaps the problem is tricking us? Maybe EF is not a side? Let’s check the labeling.\n\nIn square EFGH, the vertices are labeled in order: E → F → G → H → E. So EF is indeed a side.\n\nAlso, the problem says: “square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD...” — so it’s a rigid translation, meaning all side lengths are preserved.\n\nTherefore, **EF = 7**.\n\nBut why give all the other information — about E on BC, H on CD, centers O1 and O2? That seems like red herring, or perhaps the problem is misstated?\n\nWait — let’s reread the question carefully:\n\n> “Given this configuration, find the length of segment EF.”\n\nBut EF is a side of the square — so unless the square is somehow distorted (which it isn’t — it’s a translation), EF must be 7.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem meant to ask for the **distance between centers O1 and O2**, or the **distance between E and F** if EF were not a side? But EF is a side.\n\nWait — perhaps the problem is in 3D? But the diagram is 2D, and translation perpendicular to CD in 2D would mean moving in the plane perpendicular to CD — which is still in the plane.\n\nAlternatively, maybe “EF” is not the side, but a diagonal? But no — in square EFGH, EF is adjacent vertices.\n\nLet me sketch mentally:\n\nAssume square ABCD is positioned with:\n\n- A at bottom right\n- B at top right\n- C at top left\n- D at bottom left\n\nSo side CD is the top side? Wait — depends on labeling.\n\nStandard labeling: ABCD labeled clockwise.\n\nAssume:\n\n- A(0,0), B(7,0), C(7,7), D(0,7) — so CD is from (7,7) to (0,7), i.e., top side, horizontal.\n\nThen translating **perpendicularly to CD** — CD is horizontal, so perpendicular is vertical — either up or down.\n\nBut point E lies on side BC — BC is from B(7,0) to C(7,7), so vertical right side.\n\nPoint H lies on side CD — top side.\n\nSo if we translate square ABCD vertically (perpendicular to CD), then:\n\n- Original square: A(0,0), B(7,0), C(7,7), D(0,7)\n\nTranslate it **upward** by some amount h.\n\nThen new square EFGH:\n\n- E = B translated up: (7, h)\n- F = C translated up: (7, 7+h)\n- G = D translated up: (0, 7+h)\n- H = A translated up: (0, h)\n\nWait — but then H is at (0,h), which should lie on CD — CD is from (7,7) to (0,7), so y=7.\n\nSo for H to lie on CD, its y-coordinate must be 7. So h = 7.\n\nThen H = (0,7) — which is point D.\n\nAnd E = (7,7) — which is point C.\n\nBut the problem says E lies on BC — BC is from (7,0) to (7,7), so (7,7) is point C, which is endpoint of BC — so yes, it lies on BC.\n\nSimilarly, H = (0,7) lies on CD.\n\nSo translation is **upward by 7 units**.\n\nThen square EFGH has:\n\n- E(7,7), F(7,14), G(0,14), H(0,7)\n\nThen EF is from (7,7) to (7,14) — vertical side, length = 7.\n\nSo again, EF = 7.\n\nAlternatively, if we translate **downward**, then E would be (7,-h), which would not lie on BC (which is from y=0 to y=7), unless h=0, which is no translation.\n\nSo only upward translation by 7 works.\n\nThus, EF is vertical, length 7.\n\nTherefore, the answer is 7.\n\nBut why all the fuss with centers? Let’s check centers.\n\nCenter O1 of ABCD: average of coordinates: ((0+7)/2, (0+7)/2) = (3.5, 3.5)\n\nCenter O2 of EFGH: E(7,7), F(7,14), G(0,14), H(0,7) → center = ((7+0)/2, (7+14)/2) = (3.5, 10.5)\n\nDistance between O1 and O2: |10.5 - 3.5| = 7 — which is the translation distance.\n\nBut the question is not asking for that.\n\nSo, after all this, **EF is a side of the square, and the square has side length 7, so EF = 7**.\n\nPerhaps the problem meant to ask for something else, like the distance between E and F if they were not adjacent? But they are.\n\nOr perhaps there’s a mislabeling? For example, if EF were a diagonal, but in square EFGH, EF is adjacent.\n\nUnless the square is labeled differently — but standard is consecutive vertices.\n\nAnother possibility: maybe “EF” is not the side of the square, but a segment connecting E and F in some other context? But the square is EFGH, so EF is a side.\n\nI think the problem is straightforward, and the extra information is to confirm the configuration, but the answer is simply 7.\n\nPerhaps the problem is testing whether you get distracted by the centers and positions, but the length of EF is given by the side length.\n\nSo, final answer:\n\n$\\boxed{7}$"
