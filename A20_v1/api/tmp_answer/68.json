Vertex-on-center derivation: 3-gon (center O2) with radius equal to base 3-gon radius. Round 2: applying 'translation' rule. Translation derivation: 3-sided polygon (new center O3) translated right. Found 11 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 0 new lines and 0 new arcs generated by splitting.

    "In the given geometric configuration, triangle ABC (centered at O1) is an equilateral triangle with side length 4. A second equilateral triangle, DEC (centered at O2), is constructed such that vertex C of triangle ABC coincides with the center O2 of triangle DEC, and side DE is aligned vertically. A third equilateral triangle, FGH (centered at O3), is obtained by translating triangle DEC horizontally to the right. Point D is a vertex of triangle DEC, and point O1 is the center of triangle ABC. Find the length of segment O1D."
