    "We are given a regular pentagon $ABCDE$ with center $O_1$ and side length 4. Inside it, a second regular pentagon $FGHIJ$ is inscribed, sharing the same center $O_1$. We are to find the length of segment $JF$.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\nSince both pentagons are regular and share the same center, and the inner pentagon is inscribed within the outer one, the inner pentagon’s vertices lie on the sides of the outer pentagon.\n\nLooking at the diagram, we see that points $F, G, H, I, J$ lie on the sides of pentagon $ABCDE$. Specifically:\n\n- $F$ lies on side $AB$\n- $G$ lies on side $BC$\n- $H$ lies on side $CD$\n- $I$ lies on side $DE$\n- $J$ lies on side $EA$\n\nThis is a standard construction: a regular pentagon inscribed in another regular pentagon by placing its vertices at equal divisions along the sides of the outer pentagon.\n\nIn such a configuration, the inner pentagon is rotated relative to the outer one, and the vertices of the inner pentagon divide the sides of the outer pentagon in a specific ratio — often the **golden ratio**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use properties of regular pentagons and the golden ratio\n\nIn a regular pentagon, the diagonals intersect each other in the **golden ratio** $\\phi = \\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2} \\approx 1.618$.\n\nMoreover, when you inscribe a regular pentagon inside another by placing its vertices on the sides of the outer pentagon, the ratio of the side length of the inner pentagon to the outer pentagon is:\n\n$$\n\\frac{s_{\\text{inner}}}{s_{\\text{outer}}} = \\frac{1}{\\phi^2} = \\frac{1}{\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{5}}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{4}{(1+\\sqrt{5})^2} = \\frac{4}{6 + 2\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{2}{3 + \\sqrt{5}}\n$$\n\nRationalizing:\n\n$$\n\\frac{2}{3 + \\sqrt{5}} \\cdot \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{3 - \\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{2(3 - \\sqrt{5})}{9 - 5} = \\frac{2(3 - \\sqrt{5})}{4} = \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2}\n$$\n\nSo the side length of the inner pentagon is:\n\n$$\ns_{\\text{inner}} = 4 \\cdot \\frac{3 - \\sqrt{5}}{2} = 2(3 - \\sqrt{5}) = 6 - 2\\sqrt{5}\n$$\n\nBut wait — **is $JF$ a side of the inner pentagon?**\n\nLooking at the diagram:\n\n- The inner pentagon is $FGHIJ$, so its sides are $FG, GH, HI, IJ, JF$.\n\nTherefore, **$JF$ is a side of the inner pentagon**.\n\nThus, the length of segment $JF$ is equal to the side length of the inner pentagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final calculation\n\nWe have:\n\n$$\nJF = s_{\\text{inner}} = 6 - 2\\sqrt{5}\n$$\n\nLet’s verify this value numerically to check reasonableness:\n\n- $\\sqrt{5} \\approx 2.236$\n- $2\\sqrt{5} \\approx 4.472$\n- $6 - 4.472 \\approx 1.528$\n\nThis is less than 4, which makes sense since it’s the inner pentagon.\n\nAlternatively, we can derive this using coordinates or vectors, but the golden ratio approach is standard and well-established for regular pentagons.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{6 - 2\\sqrt{5}}\n$$"
