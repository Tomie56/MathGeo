    "We are given a diagram with two congruent squares: square ABCD centered at O₁ and square EFGH centered at O₂. Square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD perpendicularly to side CD. We are told that each side of the square measures 7 units, and we are to find the length of segment BD, which connects vertices B and D of square ABCD.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry of square ABCD\n\nIn any square, the diagonals are equal in length and bisect each other at 90°. The diagonal of a square can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem.\n\nLet’s label the square ABCD with vertices in order (say, clockwise):\n\n- A — top right\n- B — top left\n- C — bottom left\n- D — bottom right\n\nThen, segment BD connects top left (B) to bottom right (D), which is a diagonal of the square.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the Pythagorean Theorem to find diagonal BD\n\nIn square ABCD, each side is 7 units.\n\nConsider triangle BCD (or ABD — either right triangle formed by two sides and the diagonal).\n\nActually, better to consider triangle ABD or CBD — but simplest is to consider the right triangle formed by two adjacent sides and the diagonal.\n\nLet’s consider triangle ABD: but actually, points A, B, D — A to B is one side, A to D is another side, and B to D is the diagonal.\n\nWait — actually, in square ABCD, if we go from B to D, we are going across the square diagonally.\n\nThe two legs of the right triangle that form the diagonal are the sides of the square: AB and AD (if A is the corner between them).\n\nBut to be precise, let’s define coordinates to make it clear.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Assign coordinates to square ABCD\n\nLet’s place square ABCD on the coordinate plane for clarity.\n\nAssume:\n\n- Point D is at the origin: D = (0, 0)\n- Since side length is 7, and assuming standard orientation:\n\n  - C = (0, 7)  [up from D]\n  - B = (7, 7)  [right from C]\n  - A = (7, 0)  [down from B]\n\nWait — that would make D(0,0), C(0,7), B(7,7), A(7,0). Then side CD is from C(0,7) to D(0,0) — vertical.\n\nBut then BD is from B(7,7) to D(0,0). That’s a diagonal.\n\nAlternatively, if we want BD to be from top-left to bottom-right, let’s adjust:\n\nLet’s define:\n\n- A = (0, 7) — top left\n- B = (7, 7) — top right\n- C = (7, 0) — bottom right\n- D = (0, 0) — bottom left\n\nThen BD connects B(7,7) to D(0,0) — again, diagonal.\n\nEither way, the diagonal spans 7 units horizontally and 7 units vertically.\n\nSo, the length of diagonal BD is:\n\n\\[\nBD = \\sqrt{(7)^2 + (7)^2} = \\sqrt{49 + 49} = \\sqrt{98}\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{98} = \\sqrt{49 \\cdot 2} = 7\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm relevance of other information\n\nThe problem mentions square EFGH, translation, centers O₁ and O₂, and that EFGH is translated perpendicularly to side CD. However, the question asks only for the length of segment BD in square ABCD.\n\nSince BD is a diagonal of square ABCD, and we are given the side length (7 units), the other information (about EFGH and translation) is **irrelevant** to computing BD.\n\nThis is likely included to test whether the student can identify the essential information.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7\\sqrt{2}}\n\\]"
