    "We are given a geometric diagram with two congruent squares: square ABCD (center O1) and square EFGH (center O2). They share vertex C. Square EFGH is translated perpendicularly relative to side CD of square ABCD. Point M0 is the midpoint of segment BC. A line is drawn from H to M0. The question asks:\n\n> Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by lines AB and DA at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the question\n\nThe angle formed by lines AB and DA at vertex A is simply the **interior angle of square ABCD at vertex A**.\n\nIn any square, all interior angles are **right angles**, i.e., **90 degrees**.\n\nWe are asked to give the answer in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Convert degrees to radians\n\nWe know:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ = \\pi \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n90^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{2} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify if any other information affects this angle\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n- Two congruent squares sharing vertex C.\n- Square EFGH is translated perpendicularly relative to side CD.\n- Point M0 is the midpoint of BC.\n- A line is drawn from H to M0.\n\nHowever, **none of these details affect the angle at vertex A of square ABCD**. The angle at A is an intrinsic property of the square — it is always 90°, regardless of the position or orientation of the other square, as long as ABCD remains a square.\n\nEven if the square is rotated or translated, its internal angles remain 90°. The problem states that ABCD is a square, so we can rely on that.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n\\]"
