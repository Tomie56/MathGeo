    "In the given diagram, a larger triangle DEF is formed by scaling a smaller triangle ABC concentrically about point O1 by a factor of 2. Triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 6 and is oriented such that point A lies above segment BC. The scaled triangle DEF shares the same center O1 and orientation, with points D, E, and F corresponding to A, B, and C respectively. Segment FD is vertical and aligned with segment AC. What is the measurement of line segment FD?"

    "We are given a geometric scaling problem involving two concentric triangles: a smaller equilateral triangle ABC and a larger triangle DEF, which is a scaled version of ABC by a factor of 2 about point O1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the setup\n\n- Triangle ABC is **equilateral** with side length **6**.\n- Triangle DEF is a **scaled version** of ABC by a factor of **2**, centered at point **O1**.\n- The scaling is **concentric**, meaning O1 is the center of both triangles.\n- Points D, E, F correspond to A, B, C respectively.\n- Segment **FD is vertical** and **aligned with segment AC**.\n- We are to find the **length of segment FD**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use properties of scaling\n\nSince triangle DEF is a scaled version of triangle ABC by a factor of 2 about point O1, **every length in DEF is twice the corresponding length in ABC**.\n\nIn particular, since point F corresponds to point C, and point D corresponds to point A, then **segment FD corresponds to segment CA**.\n\nTherefore:\n\n> **FD = 2 × AC**\n\nBut AC is a side of the equilateral triangle ABC, so:\n\n> **AC = 6**\n\nThus:\n\n> **FD = 2 × 6 = 12**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Verify alignment and orientation\n\nThe problem states that **FD is vertical and aligned with AC**. Since scaling preserves angles and orientation (it’s a homothety), and since AC is mapped to FD under scaling by 2, the direction of AC is preserved in FD — so if AC is vertical, FD is also vertical. The problem confirms this alignment, so our assumption that FD corresponds directly to AC is valid.\n\nAlso, since ABC is equilateral, all sides are equal, so AC = AB = BC = 6. Thus, the side corresponding to AC in the scaled triangle is indeed FD, and its length is scaled by 2.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\n$$\n\\boxed{12}\n$$"
