    "We are given a **regular octagon** centered at point $ O_1 $, with vertices labeled $ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H $ in **counterclockwise** order. Each side has length 3. We are to find the measure of the **interior angle** $ \\angle BAH $ at vertex $ A $, formed by segments $ AB $ and $ HA $, and express it in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of a regular octagon\n\nA **regular octagon** has:\n\n- 8 equal sides\n- 8 equal interior angles\n- All vertices lie on a circle (it is cyclic)\n- The central angle between two adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $ radians\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Recall the formula for the interior angle of a regular polygon\n\nFor any regular $ n $-gon, the measure of each **interior angle** is:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{n} \\quad \\text{(in radians)}\n$$\n\nFor an octagon, $ n = 8 $:\n\n$$\n\\theta = \\frac{(8 - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{8} = \\frac{6\\pi}{8} = \\frac{3\\pi}{4}\n$$\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Interpret $ \\angle BAH $\n\nThe angle $ \\angle BAH $ is the angle at vertex $ A $, formed by the two adjacent sides: $ AB $ and $ HA $.\n\nIn a polygon, the **interior angle at a vertex** is the angle between the two edges meeting at that vertex — which is exactly what $ \\angle BAH $ is.\n\nSince the octagon is **regular**, all interior angles are equal, and we’ve just computed that each interior angle is $ \\frac{3\\pi}{4} $ radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm with geometry (optional verification)\n\nWe can also think geometrically:\n\n- The octagon is regular and centered at $ O_1 $.\n- The central angle between adjacent vertices is $ \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} $.\n- The triangle formed by two adjacent vertices and the center (e.g., $ \\triangle O_1AB $) is isosceles with two sides equal to the radius and included angle $ \\frac{\\pi}{4} $.\n- The base angles of that triangle are $ \\frac{\\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{4}}{2} = \\frac{3\\pi}{8} $.\n- But this is not directly needed — we are asked for the **interior angle** of the polygon, which we already have from the standard formula.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{4}}\n$$"
