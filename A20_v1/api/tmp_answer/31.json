    "Two circles intersect at points A and C. Circle 1, centered at O1, passes through points A, B, and C, forming triangle ABC inscribed in it. Circle 2, centered at O2, is a translation of Circle 1 to the right and also passes through A and C. Triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 9, and the entire figure is rotated by π/3 radians about O1. Given this configuration, what is the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle between segments AB and AC at vertex A?"

    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two intersecting circles and an equilateral triangle inscribed in one of them. The question asks for the **radian measure of ∠BAC**, the angle at vertex A in triangle ABC.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given information\n\n- Triangle ABC is **equilateral** with side length 9.\n- Circle 1 (centered at O1) passes through A, B, and C → so triangle ABC is **inscribed** in Circle 1.\n- Circle 2 (centered at O2) is a **translation** of Circle 1 to the right and also passes through A and C.\n- The entire figure is rotated by **π/3 radians about O1** — but this is likely **irrelevant** to the angle ∠BAC, since rotation preserves angles, and we are to find an angle *within* the triangle, which is fixed in shape.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use properties of equilateral triangles\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle**, **all interior angles are equal** and each measures:\n\n> **60 degrees** = **π/3 radians**\n\nThis is a fundamental property.\n\nSo, regardless of the circles or rotations, since triangle ABC is equilateral, the angle at vertex A — that is, ∠BAC — must be:\n\n> **∠BAC = π/3 radians**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm that the circles and rotation do not affect this angle\n\n- The fact that the triangle is inscribed in a circle (Circle 1) is consistent with any triangle being inscribed in a circumcircle — and for an equilateral triangle, the circumcenter coincides with the centroid, orthocenter, etc.\n- Circle 2 being a translation of Circle 1 and passing through A and C doesn’t change the shape or angles of triangle ABC.\n- The rotation of the entire figure by π/3 about O1 is a rigid transformation — it preserves all distances and angles. So even if we rotate the figure, ∠BAC remains unchanged.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Final Answer\n\nTherefore, the radian measure of ∠BAC is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n$$"
