    "We are given a regular octagon inscribed in a circle centered at O1, with side length 10. A triangle IJ O2 is constructed such that:\n\n- O2 is the center of triangle IJ O2 (so it’s an equilateral triangle, since “center” and “side length equals that of the octagon” implies all sides are 10 and it’s equilateral).\n- Points I and J lie on the circle centered at O1.\n- Segments O1I and O1J are drawn.\n- We are to find the radian measure of angle ∠IO1J.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the regular octagon\n\nA regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal central angles.\n\nThe central angle between two adjacent vertices of a regular octagon is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta_{\\text{octagon}} = \\frac{2\\pi}{8} = \\frac{\\pi}{4} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nSo, if we label the vertices of the octagon as A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H (as in the diagram), then the angle between any two adjacent vertices as seen from O1 is π/4.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Understand triangle IJ O2\n\nWe are told:\n\n- Triangle IJ O2 has side length equal to that of the octagon → so IJ = JO2 = O2I = 10.\n- O2 is the center of the triangle → this implies O2 is the centroid (or circumcenter, or incenter — for an equilateral triangle, all coincide).\n\nSo triangle IJ O2 is **equilateral** with side length 10.\n\nPoints I and J lie on the circle centered at O1 → so O1I = O1J = radius of the circle circumscribing the octagon.\n\nWe need to find angle ∠IO1J, which is the central angle subtended by chord IJ at center O1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find the radius R of the circle circumscribing the regular octagon\n\nFor a regular polygon with n sides of length s, the circumradius R is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nFor octagon, n = 8, s = 10:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{10}{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)} = \\frac{5}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nWe’ll keep this symbolic for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Use chord length formula to find angle ∠IO1J\n\nIn a circle of radius R, the length of a chord subtending an angle θ at the center is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{chord length} = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nHere, chord IJ has length 10 (since triangle IJ O2 is equilateral with side 10), and it lies on the circle centered at O1 with radius R.\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\n10 = 2R \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSubstitute R from Step 3:\n\n\\[\n10 = 2 \\cdot \\frac{5}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)} \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\n\\[\n10 = \\frac{10}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)} \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nDivide both sides by 10:\n\n\\[\n1 = \\frac{1}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)} \\cdot \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right)\n\\]\n\nMultiply both sides by sin(π/8):\n\n\\[\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\pi - \\frac{\\pi}{8} = \\frac{7\\pi}{8}\n\\]\n\nBut θ is the central angle ∠IO1J, and since I and J are two points on the circle, and the chord IJ = 10 (same as octagon side), and the octagon’s side also subtends angle π/4 at the center, we must consider which solution makes sense.\n\nWait — let’s double-check.\n\nActually, if chord length = 10, and the octagon’s side also has chord length 10, then the central angle for chord IJ should be the same as the central angle for a side of the octagon — which is π/4.\n\nBut according to our equation:\n\n\\[\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\n\\Rightarrow \\frac{\\theta}{2} = \\frac{\\pi}{8} \\Rightarrow \\theta = \\frac{\\pi}{4}\n\\]\n\nPerfect! So ∠IO1J = π/4 radians.\n\nBut wait — is this consistent?\n\nLet’s verify:\n\nIn the octagon, side length = 10, central angle = π/4.\n\nChord length formula: chord = 2R sin(θ/2)\n\nSo for θ = π/4, chord = 2R sin(π/8) = 10 → which matches our earlier expression for R.\n\nSo if IJ = 10, and it’s a chord of the same circle, then the central angle must be π/4.\n\nTherefore, ∠IO1J = π/4 radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: But wait — is triangle IJ O2 equilateral and inscribed such that I and J are on the circle?\n\nWe must ensure that such a triangle can exist with O2 inside and I, J on the circle.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle of side 10, the distance from a vertex to the centroid (which is also the circumcenter) is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{distance} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 10 = \\frac{10\\sqrt{3}}{3}\n\\]\n\nSo O2I = O2J = 10/√3? Wait — no.\n\nActually, in an equilateral triangle, the **circumradius** (distance from center to vertex) is:\n\n\\[\nR_{\\text{triangle}} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3}} \\approx 5.77\n\\]\n\nBut in our case, O2 is the center of triangle IJ O2, and I and J are on the circle centered at O1, which has radius R = 5 / sin(π/8) ≈ 5 / 0.3827 ≈ 13.07.\n\nSo O2 is inside the circle, and I and J are on the circle — so O2I and O2J are not radii of the big circle, but of the small triangle.\n\nThis is fine — there’s no contradiction.\n\nThe key point is: chord IJ = 10, same as octagon side, and same circle → so central angle must be same → π/4.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{4}}\n\\]"
