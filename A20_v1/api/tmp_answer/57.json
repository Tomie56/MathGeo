    "In the given diagram, two congruent squares share a common vertex at point B. Square ABCD is centered at O1, and square BEFG is centered at O2, with square BEFG translated perpendicularly from side CD of square ABCD. Point H lies at the intersection of segments BC and EG. The line segment BD is drawn, connecting vertices B and D. Express the measure of angle BAD — formed by segments AB and AD — as a radian expression."

    "We are given a geometric diagram with two **congruent squares** sharing a common vertex at point **B**:\n\n- Square **ABCD**, centered at **O1**\n- Square **BEFG**, centered at **O2**\n- Square **BEFG** is **translated perpendicularly** from side **CD** of square **ABCD**\n- Point **H** is the intersection of **BC** and **EG**\n- Segment **BD** is drawn (diagonal of square ABCD)\n- We are to find the measure of **angle BAD** — formed by segments **AB** and **AD** — **in radians**\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Understand the structure of square ABCD\n\nIn any square, all interior angles are **90 degrees** (or **π/2 radians**), and adjacent sides are perpendicular.\n\nIn square **ABCD**, the vertices are labeled in order — typically **clockwise or counterclockwise**.\n\nAssuming standard labeling:\n\n- A → B → C → D → A (say, clockwise)\n\nThen:\n\n- Segment **AB** and **AD** are **adjacent sides** meeting at vertex **A**\n- Therefore, angle **BAD** is the **interior angle at vertex A** of square ABCD\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Use properties of a square\n\nIn **any square**, each interior angle is **90 degrees**, regardless of orientation or position.\n\nSo, angle **BAD = 90°**\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Convert degrees to radians\n\nWe know:\n\n> 180° = π radians  \n> ⇒ 1° = π/180 radians  \n> ⇒ 90° = (π/180) × 90 = **π/2 radians**\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Verify if the other information affects this\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n- Another square **BEFG**, congruent to ABCD, sharing vertex **B**\n- Translated perpendicularly from side **CD**\n- Point **H** at intersection of **BC** and **EG**\n- Diagonal **BD** is drawn\n\nBut **none of this affects angle BAD**, which is an **interior angle of square ABCD at vertex A**.\n\nThe position or orientation of square BEFG, or the existence of point H or diagonal BD, does **not alter** the internal geometry of square ABCD.\n\nThus, angle BAD remains **π/2 radians**.\n\n---\n\n## ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n$$"
