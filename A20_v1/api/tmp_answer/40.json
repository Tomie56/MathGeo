    "We are given a geometric figure involving two concentric triangles: a smaller regular (equilateral) triangle with side length 6 and center O1, and a larger triangle formed by scaling the smaller one by a factor of 2 about the same center O1.\n\nWe are to find the length of segment M0M1, where:\n\n- M0 is the midpoint of side BC (of the smaller triangle),\n- M1 is the midpoint of side DE (of the larger triangle).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the configuration\n\nSince the larger triangle is a **concentric scaling** of the smaller one by factor 2, and both are **regular (equilateral) triangles**, they are similar and share the same center O1.\n\nLet’s denote:\n\n- Smaller triangle: ABC (with side length 6)\n- Larger triangle: DEF (with side length 12, since scaled by 2)\n\nPoints:\n\n- M0 = midpoint of BC\n- M1 = midpoint of DE\n\nWe are to find the distance between M0 and M1.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use coordinate geometry for clarity\n\nPlace the figure on the coordinate plane with center O1 at the origin (0, 0).\n\nFor an equilateral triangle centered at the origin, we can place its vertices using symmetry.\n\n#### Coordinates of smaller triangle ABC (side length 6)\n\nIn an equilateral triangle centered at the origin, the distance from the center to a vertex is the **circumradius** R.\n\nFor an equilateral triangle of side length s, the circumradius is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nWait — correction: Actually, the formula for the circumradius of an equilateral triangle is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\text{height} = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}s = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3}s? \\quad \\text{No, let's recall correctly.}\n\\]\n\nActually, the **height** h of an equilateral triangle is:\n\n\\[\nh = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s\n\\]\n\nThe centroid (which coincides with the circumcenter in an equilateral triangle) is located at 2/3 of the height from a vertex.\n\nSo, the distance from the center to a vertex (circumradius) is:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot h = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3} \\cdot \\sqrt{3}}{3}? \\quad \\text{Wait, simplify:}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} s = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}}\n\\]\n\nActually, \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}\\), so yes:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{\\sqrt{3}} \\quad \\text{?} \\quad \\text{Wait, let's compute numerically for s=6:}\n\\]\n\nHeight = \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} \\cdot 6 = 3\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nCentroid is 2/3 of the way from vertex to base → distance from center to vertex = \\(\\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 3\\sqrt{3} = 2\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nSo, **circumradius R = \\(2\\sqrt{3}\\)** for the smaller triangle.\n\nThus, for side length 6, R = \\(2\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\nSimilarly, for the larger triangle (side length 12), R = \\(4\\sqrt{3}\\)\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Assign coordinates\n\nPlace triangle ABC with center at (0,0).\n\nLet’s place vertex A at the top: (0, R) = (0, \\(2\\sqrt{3}\\))\n\nThen, since it’s equilateral, the other two vertices B and C are located at 120° and 240° from the positive y-axis? Or easier: place them symmetrically.\n\nStandard placement for equilateral triangle centered at origin:\n\nLet’s place:\n\n- A at (0, R) = (0, \\(2\\sqrt{3}\\))\n- B at (R * cos(210°), R * sin(210°)) = (2√3 * cos(210°), 2√3 * sin(210°))\n- C at (R * cos(330°), R * sin(330°))\n\nBut cos(210°) = cos(180°+30°) = -cos(30°) = -√3/2\n\nsin(210°) = -sin(30°) = -1/2\n\nSimilarly, cos(330°) = cos(-30°) = √3/2, sin(330°) = -1/2\n\nSo:\n\n- A: (0, 2√3)\n- B: (2√3 * (-√3/2), 2√3 * (-1/2)) = (2√3 * -√3/2, 2√3 * -1/2) = (-3, -√3)\n- C: (2√3 * √3/2, 2√3 * -1/2) = (3, -√3)\n\nCheck distance BC:\n\nB = (-3, -√3), C = (3, -√3)\n\nDistance = √[(3 - (-3))² + (-√3 - (-√3))²] = √[6² + 0] = 6 → correct.\n\nDistance AB:\n\nA = (0, 2√3), B = (-3, -√3)\n\nΔx = -3, Δy = -√3 - 2√3 = -3√3\n\nDistance = √[(-3)^2 + (-3√3)^2] = √[9 + 27] = √36 = 6 → correct.\n\nGood.\n\nSo:\n\n- A: (0, 2√3)\n- B: (-3, -√3)\n- C: (3, -√3)\n\nThen, M0 = midpoint of BC:\n\nB = (-3, -√3), C = (3, -√3)\n\nMidpoint M0 = ((-3+3)/2, (-√3 + (-√3))/2) = (0, -√3)\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Coordinates of larger triangle DEF\n\nScaled by factor 2 about center O1 = (0,0)\n\nSo, each vertex of DEF is 2 times the vector from O1 to the corresponding vertex of ABC.\n\nSo:\n\n- D = 2 * A = 2*(0, 2√3) = (0, 4√3)\n- E = 2 * B = 2*(-3, -√3) = (-6, -2√3)\n- F = 2 * C = 2*(3, -√3) = (6, -2√3)\n\nCheck side length: distance between E and F:\n\nE = (-6, -2√3), F = (6, -2√3)\n\nDistance = √[(6 - (-6))² + 0] = √[12²] = 12 → correct.\n\nNow, M1 = midpoint of DE\n\nD = (0, 4√3), E = (-6, -2√3)\n\nMidpoint M1 = ((0 + (-6))/2, (4√3 + (-2√3))/2) = (-3, √3)\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute distance between M0 and M1\n\nM0 = (0, -√3)\n\nM1 = (-3, √3)\n\nDistance M0M1 = √[(-3 - 0)^2 + (√3 - (-√3))^2] = √[(-3)^2 + (2√3)^2] = √[9 + 4*3] = √[9 + 12] = √21\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\sqrt{21}}\n\\]"
