    "Two circles intersect at points A and C. The left circle, centered at O₁, passes through points A, B, and C, forming triangle ABC inscribed in it. The right circle, centered at O₂, is a translation of the left circle to the right and also passes through A and C. Segment AB is a chord of the left circle, and segment AC is a common chord of both circles. Given that triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 9, determine the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle formed at point A by segments AB and AC."

    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two intersecting circles and an equilateral triangle ABC inscribed in the left circle (centered at O₁). The right circle (centered at O₂) is a translation of the left circle and also passes through points A and C. We are told that triangle ABC is **equilateral** with side length 9, and we are to find the **radian measure of ∠BAC**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the properties of an equilateral triangle\n\nIn an **equilateral triangle**, all three sides are equal, and all three interior angles are equal.\n\nSince the sum of interior angles in any triangle is π radians (or 180°), each angle in an equilateral triangle is:\n\n\\[\n\\angle BAC = \\angle ABC = \\angle ACB = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Confirm that ∠BAC is indeed an interior angle of triangle ABC\n\nThe problem asks for the angle formed at point A by segments AB and AC — that is, **∠BAC**, which is the angle between sides AB and AC at vertex A.\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral, this angle is one of the three equal interior angles.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Final Answer\n\nTherefore, regardless of the circles or their centers, the angle ∠BAC in an equilateral triangle is always:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Note on the circles (for completeness):\n\nThe presence of the two circles and their centers (O₁ and O₂) is likely included to provide context or to set up a more complex problem, but **the question specifically asks for ∠BAC in triangle ABC, which is given to be equilateral**. Thus, the circle information is **not needed** to compute ∠BAC — it is purely a property of the equilateral triangle.\n\n---\n\n✅ Final Answer: $\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}$"
