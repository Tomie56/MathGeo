    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon is inscribed within another regular pentagon, both sharing the same center O1. The outer pentagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E in counterclockwise order, and the inner pentagon has vertices labeled F, G, H, I, J, also in counterclockwise order. Point M0 lies on segment IJ and is the midpoint of segment L8 (assumed to be segment IJ based on context). A line is drawn from vertex G to point M0. Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by line segments AB and EA at vertex A."

    "We are asked to find the **radian measure of the angle formed by line segments AB and EA at vertex A** in the outer regular pentagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometric context\n\nWe are told that:\n\n- There is an **outer regular pentagon** with vertices labeled **A, B, C, D, E** in **counterclockwise** order.\n- There is an **inner regular pentagon** with vertices **F, G, H, I, J**, also counterclockwise, sharing the same center **O1**.\n- Point **M0** lies on segment **IJ** and is the midpoint of segment **L8** — which we are told to assume is **IJ**.\n- A line is drawn from **G to M0** — but this is **irrelevant** to the question we are being asked.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Focus on the actual question\n\n> Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by line segments **AB** and **EA** at vertex **A**.\n\nThis is asking for the **interior angle** at vertex **A** of the **regular pentagon ABCDE**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Formula for interior angle of a regular polygon\n\nFor any regular polygon with **n** sides, the measure of each **interior angle** in **radians** is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{(n - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{n}\n\\]\n\nFor a **pentagon**, \\( n = 5 \\):\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{(5 - 2) \\cdot \\pi}{5} = \\frac{3\\pi}{5}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm this is the angle between AB and EA at A\n\nIn polygon ABCDE, the sides meeting at vertex A are:\n\n- **EA** (coming from E to A)\n- **AB** (going from A to B)\n\nSo the angle between segments **EA** and **AB** at vertex A is indeed the **interior angle** of the pentagon at A.\n\nSince the pentagon is **regular**, all interior angles are equal, and each is \\( \\frac{3\\pi}{5} \\) radians.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Final Answer\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}}\n\\]"
