    "We are given a regular octagon inscribed in a circle centered at O1, with side length 10. Points A and C are vertices of the octagon, and we are to find the length of segment CA.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure of the regular octagon\n\nA regular octagon has 8 equal sides and 8 equal central angles. Since it is inscribed in a circle, each vertex lies on the circle, and the central angle between two adjacent vertices is:\n\n\\[\n\\theta = \\frac{360^\\circ}{8} = 45^\\circ\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Determine the angular separation between points A and C\n\nWe are told that segment CA connects two vertices of the octagon. We must determine how many sides apart A and C are.\n\nLooking at the diagram (even though we can’t see it, the labeling suggests a standard labeling), the vertices are labeled in order: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H — going around the circle.\n\nSo from A to B is 1 side, B to C is another side → so A to C is **2 sides apart**.\n\nTherefore, the central angle ∠AO₁C is:\n\n\\[\n\\angle AO_1C = 2 \\times 45^\\circ = 90^\\circ\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Use the Law of Cosines in triangle AO₁C\n\nIn triangle AO₁C:\n\n- O₁A = O₁C = radius of the circle (let’s call it R)\n- ∠AO₁C = 90°\n- We want to find CA.\n\nBy the Law of Cosines:\n\n\\[\nCA^2 = O_1A^2 + O_1C^2 - 2 \\cdot O_1A \\cdot O_1C \\cdot \\cos(\\angle AO_1C)\n\\]\n\nSince O₁A = O₁C = R, and ∠AO₁C = 90°, cos(90°) = 0, so:\n\n\\[\nCA^2 = R^2 + R^2 - 2R^2 \\cdot 0 = 2R^2\n\\Rightarrow CA = R\\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo we need to find R, the radius of the circle circumscribing the regular octagon with side length 10.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Find the radius R of the circumscribed circle of a regular octagon with side length s = 10\n\nIn a regular polygon with n sides of length s, the radius R of the circumscribed circle is given by:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{s}{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{n}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nFor a regular octagon, n = 8, s = 10:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{10}{2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)} = \\frac{5}{\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)}\n\\]\n\nWe need to compute \\(\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\pi}{8}\\right)\\). Note that \\(\\frac{\\pi}{8} = 22.5^\\circ\\), and we can use the half-angle identity:\n\n\\[\n\\sin\\left(\\frac{\\theta}{2}\\right) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos\\theta}{2}}\n\\]\n\nLet θ = 45°, so:\n\n\\[\n\\sin(22.5^\\circ) = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\cos(45^\\circ)}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{1 - \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2 - \\sqrt{2}}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}\n\\]\n\nTherefore:\n\n\\[\nR = \\frac{5}{\\frac{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}{2}} = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]\n\nWe can rationalize this expression, but perhaps it’s easier to compute numerically for verification, or keep symbolic for now.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Compute CA = R√2\n\n\\[\nCA = R \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{10 \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]\n\nLet’s simplify this expression.\n\nMultiply numerator and denominator by \\(\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}\\) to rationalize the denominator:\n\nNote that:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}} = \\sqrt{(2 - \\sqrt{2})(2 + \\sqrt{2})} = \\sqrt{4 - 2} = \\sqrt{2}\n\\]\n\nSo:\n\n\\[\nCA = \\frac{10 \\sqrt{2}}{\\sqrt{2 - \\sqrt{2}}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}} = \\frac{10 \\sqrt{2} \\cdot \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}{\\sqrt{2}} = 10 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Final Answer\n\nThus, the length of segment CA is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Optional: Numerical Approximation\n\nIf needed, we can compute a decimal approximation:\n\n- √2 ≈ 1.4142\n- 2 + √2 ≈ 3.4142\n- √(2 + √2) ≈ √3.4142 ≈ 1.8478\n- So CA ≈ 10 × 1.8478 ≈ 18.478\n\nBut since the problem asks for an exact value, we leave it in radical form.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10 \\sqrt{2 + \\sqrt{2}}}\n\\]"
