    "In the given geometric configuration, a regular triangle centered at point O1 with side length 6 is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2, resulting in a larger triangle DEF enclosing a smaller triangle ABC, both sharing the same center O1. Points A, B, and C lie on the inner triangle, and points D, E, and F lie on the outer triangle, with corresponding vertices aligned radially from O1. Line AB and Line CA intersect at vertex A. Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by Line AB and Line CA at point A."

    "We are given a geometric configuration involving two concentric regular triangles (equilateral triangles) centered at point O1:\n\n- The **inner triangle** is ABC, with side length 6.\n- The **outer triangle** is DEF, obtained by scaling ABC **concentrically** by a factor of 2.\n- Points A, B, C lie on the inner triangle; D, E, F lie on the outer triangle, with corresponding vertices aligned radially from O1.\n- We are to find the **radian measure of the angle formed by Line AB and Line CA at point A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the angle at point A\n\nThe angle formed by **Line AB** and **Line CA** at point A is the **interior angle of triangle ABC at vertex A**.\n\nSince triangle ABC is a **regular triangle** (i.e., equilateral triangle), **all its interior angles are equal**.\n\nIn any equilateral triangle, each interior angle measures:\n\n> **60 degrees**\n\nWe are asked to express this angle in **radians**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Convert degrees to radians\n\nThe conversion formula is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{radians} = \\text{degrees} \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n60^\\circ \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{\\pi}{3} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm relevance of scaling and concentricity\n\nThe problem mentions that triangle DEF is a scaled version of ABC by factor 2, centered at O1, and that corresponding vertices are radially aligned. However, **this scaling does not affect the interior angles of triangle ABC**.\n\nAngles are **invariant under scaling** — scaling changes side lengths and areas, but **not angles**.\n\nTherefore, the angle at vertex A in triangle ABC remains **60 degrees**, or **π/3 radians**, regardless of the outer triangle DEF.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{3}}\n\\]"
