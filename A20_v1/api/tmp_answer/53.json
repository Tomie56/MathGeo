    "Two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, are positioned such that square EFGH is translated perpendicularly from square ABCD along the direction of side CD, sharing vertex C (which coincides with H). The center of square ABCD is O1, and the center of square EFGH is O2. Point M0 is the midpoint of segment BC. A line segment is drawn connecting point H (which is point C) to point M0. Given that each square has side length 7, what is the radian measure of the angle ∠BAD formed at vertex A by the lines AB and AD?"

    "We are given two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, each with side length 7. Square EFGH is translated perpendicularly from square ABCD along the direction of side CD, and they share vertex C (which coincides with H). We are asked to find the **radian measure of angle ∠BAD** formed at vertex A by lines AB and AD.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry of square ABCD\n\nIn any square, all interior angles are right angles — that is, **90 degrees**.\n\nVertex A is one corner of square ABCD. The sides AB and AD are adjacent sides meeting at A. Therefore, the angle between them, ∠BAD, is the interior angle of the square at vertex A.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Convert degrees to radians\n\nWe know:\n\n> 180 degrees = π radians\n\nSo,\n\n> 90 degrees = π/2 radians\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm that the position of the second square does not affect ∠BAD\n\nThe problem introduces square EFGH and various points (O1, O2, M0, H=C), but **none of these affect the angle ∠BAD**, which is an internal angle of square ABCD.\n\nThe angle ∠BAD is purely determined by the geometry of square ABCD, which is fixed: it’s a square with side length 7, so all angles are 90°, regardless of how another square is positioned relative to it.\n\n---\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nThe radian measure of ∠BAD is:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{\\frac{\\pi}{2}}\n$$"
