    "We are given a **regular octagon** inscribed in a circle centered at **O1**, with **side length 10**. The vertices are labeled **A through H** consecutively in **counterclockwise** order. The question asks for the **length of segment HA**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the structure\n\nIn a **regular octagon**, all sides are equal in length, and all interior angles are equal. Since it is **inscribed in a circle**, all vertices lie on the circle, and the center of the circle (O1) is also the center of the octagon.\n\nThe vertices are labeled **A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H** in **counterclockwise** order.\n\nSo, the sides of the octagon are:\n\n- AB\n- BC\n- CD\n- DE\n- EF\n- FG\n- GH\n- **HA**\n\nNote: Since it’s a closed polygon with 8 vertices, the last side connects **H back to A**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Use the given information\n\nWe are told:\n\n> “A regular octagon with center O1 and **side length 10** is inscribed in a circle centered at O1.”\n\nThis means **every side of the octagon has length 10**.\n\nTherefore, **segment HA**, being one of the sides of the octagon, must also have length **10**.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Confirm labeling\n\nThe problem says: “Points A through H are the vertices of the octagon, labeled consecutively in counterclockwise order. Segment HA is one side of the octagon.”\n\nThis confirms that **HA is a side**, not a diagonal.\n\nIn a regular octagon, consecutive vertices are connected by sides. Since H is followed by A (as it wraps around), HA is indeed a side.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Conclusion\n\nSince the octagon is **regular** and has **side length 10**, **every side**, including **HA**, has length **10**.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{10}\n$$"
