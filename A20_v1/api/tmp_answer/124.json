    "In the given diagram, a regular octagon with center O1 and side length 10 is inscribed in a circle centered at O1. A triangle I-J-O2 is constructed such that O2 is its center and its side length equals that of the octagon. Points M0 and M1 are the midpoints of sides GH and BC of the octagon, respectively, and are connected by a line segment. The angle ∠I-O1-J is formed at center O1 by segments O1-I and O1-J. \n\nWhat is the measure of angle I-O1-J in radians?"
