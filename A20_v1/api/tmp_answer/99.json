    "We are given a diagram with two regular pentagons: an outer regular pentagon **ABCDE** and an inner regular pentagon **FGHJI**, both centered at **O1**. We are told that **ABCDE** has side length 4, and we are to find the **radian measure** of the interior angle **∠BAE** at vertex **A** of the outer pentagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nThe key point is that **ABCDE** is a **regular pentagon**. In a regular pentagon, **all interior angles are equal**, and **all sides are equal**.\n\nWe are asked for the interior angle at vertex **A**, which is **∠BAE** — the angle formed by sides **AB** and **AE** meeting at vertex **A**.\n\nThis is a **standard interior angle** of a regular pentagon.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Formula for interior angle of a regular polygon\n\nFor any regular polygon with **n** sides, the measure of each **interior angle** in **degrees** is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interior angle} = \\frac{(n - 2) \\times 180^\\circ}{n}\n\\]\n\nFor a pentagon, **n = 5**:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Interior angle} = \\frac{(5 - 2) \\times 180^\\circ}{5} = \\frac{3 \\times 180^\\circ}{5} = \\frac{540^\\circ}{5} = 108^\\circ\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Convert degrees to radians\n\nWe are asked for the **radian measure**.\n\nRecall:\n\n\\[\n180^\\circ = \\pi \\text{ radians}\n\\Rightarrow 1^\\circ = \\frac{\\pi}{180} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\nSo,\n\n\\[\n108^\\circ = 108 \\times \\frac{\\pi}{180} = \\frac{108\\pi}{180}\n\\]\n\nSimplify the fraction:\n\nDivide numerator and denominator by 36:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{108 \\div 36}{180 \\div 36} = \\frac{3}{5}\n\\Rightarrow 108^\\circ = \\frac{3\\pi}{5} \\text{ radians}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Confirm relevance of other elements\n\nThe problem mentions:\n\n- An inner pentagon **FGHJI** centered at **O1**.\n- Point **F0** on extension of **GH** such that **HF0 ⊥ GH**.\n\nHowever, **none of these affect the interior angle ∠BAE** of the outer pentagon **ABCDE**, which is a regular pentagon. The interior angle at any vertex of a regular pentagon is always **108°**, or **3π/5 radians**, regardless of other constructions, as long as the pentagon remains regular.\n\nThus, the extra information is **distracting** and not needed for solving this particular question.\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{3\\pi}{5}}\n\\]"
