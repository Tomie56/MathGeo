    "Two circles intersect at points A and C. The left circle is centered at O₁ and passes through vertices A, B, and C of an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 9. The right circle is centered at O₂ and is a translation of the left circle to the right, also passing through A and C. The arc BC lies on the left circle (center O₁). Find the length of arc BC."

    "We are given:\n\n- Two circles intersect at points A and C.\n- The left circle is centered at O₁ and passes through A, B, and C — so triangle ABC is inscribed in the left circle.\n- Triangle ABC is **equilateral** with side length 9.\n- The right circle is a **translation** of the left circle to the right, and also passes through A and C.\n- We are to find the **length of arc BC** on the **left circle** (center O₁).\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Understand the geometry\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral and inscribed in the left circle (center O₁), the circle is the **circumcircle** of triangle ABC.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the **circumcenter** (O₁) coincides with the centroid and orthocenter, and lies at the intersection of the perpendicular bisectors.\n\nThe key is to find the **central angle** ∠BO₁C, because the arc length is given by:\n\n> **Arc length = r × θ**, where θ is the central angle in **radians**, and r is the radius.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Find the radius of the circumcircle of equilateral triangle ABC\n\nFor an equilateral triangle with side length **s**, the circumradius **R** is:\n\n> **R = s / √3**\n\nWait — let’s recall the correct formula.\n\nActually, the formula for the circumradius **R** of an equilateral triangle is:\n\n> **R = s / (√3) × (2/3) ???**\n\nNo — better to derive or recall correctly.\n\nIn an equilateral triangle, the height **h** is:\n\n> **h = (√3 / 2) × s**\n\nThe centroid (which is also the circumcenter) lies at 2/3 of the height from any vertex.\n\nSo:\n\n> **R = (2/3) × h = (2/3) × (√3 / 2) × s = (√3 / 3) × s = s / √3**\n\nWait — let’s compute numerically:\n\nLet s = 9.\n\nHeight h = (√3 / 2) × 9 = (9√3)/2\n\nCircumradius R = (2/3) × h = (2/3) × (9√3)/2 = (18√3)/6 = **3√3**\n\n✅ So, **R = 3√3**\n\nAlternatively, standard formula: for any triangle, R = a / (2 sin A)\n\nIn equilateral triangle, all angles are 60°, so:\n\n> R = s / (2 sin 60°) = 9 / (2 × √3/2) = 9 / √3 = 3√3\n\nSame result.\n\nSo, **radius r = 3√3**\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Find the central angle ∠BO₁C\n\nSince triangle ABC is equilateral and inscribed in the circle, the central angles corresponding to each side are equal.\n\nThe full circle is 360°, and there are 3 equal arcs: arc AB, arc BC, arc CA.\n\nSo each arc corresponds to **360° / 3 = 120°**\n\nTherefore, **∠BO₁C = 120°**\n\nConvert to radians:\n\n> 120° = 120 × (π / 180) = (2π)/3 radians\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Compute arc length BC\n\nArc length = r × θ = (3√3) × (2π/3)\n\nSimplify:\n\n> (3√3) × (2π/3) = (3/3) × 2π × √3 = 1 × 2π√3 = **2π√3**\n\n---\n\n### ✅ Final Answer:\n\n$$\n\\boxed{2\\pi\\sqrt{3}}\n$$"
