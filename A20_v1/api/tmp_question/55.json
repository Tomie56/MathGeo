    "In the given diagram, two congruent squares are positioned such that square ABCD (center O1) and square EFGH (center O2) share vertex C, and square EFGH is translated perpendicularly relative to side CD of square ABCD. Point M0 is the midpoint of segment BC. A line is drawn connecting vertex H to point M0. Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by lines AB and DA at vertex A."
