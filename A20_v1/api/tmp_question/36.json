    "In the given geometric figure, a larger triangle DEF is formed by scaling a smaller triangle ABC (centered at O1) by a factor of 2, preserving concentricity. Triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 6 and rotated by π/3 radians. Point A is a shared vertex of both triangles, with segments AB and AC forming two sides of the inner triangle. Express the angle at point A between line segments AB and AC as a radian expression."
