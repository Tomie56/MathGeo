    "In the given figure, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation. A third polygon — an equilateral triangle centered at O2 — is derived such that one of its vertices coincides with the center O2, and its side length equals that of the original pentagon. The points F and G are adjacent vertices of the inner pentagon. Determine the length of segment FG."
