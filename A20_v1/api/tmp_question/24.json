    "Two circles with centers O₁ and O₂ intersect at points A and C. A regular triangle ABC is inscribed in the circle centered at O₁, with side length 9. The circle centered at O₂ is obtained by translating the circle centered at O₁ to the right. Point B lies on the circumference of the circle centered at O₁. Segment AC is a common chord of both circles. Arc A–O₁ refers to the arc along the circumference of the circle centered at O₁, from point A to point O₁, passing through the interior of triangle ABC.\n\nWhat is the length of Arc A–O₁?"
