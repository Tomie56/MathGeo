    "In the given geometric configuration, triangle ABC (centered at O1) is an equilateral triangle with side length 4. A second equilateral triangle, DEC (centered at O2), is derived by placing one of its vertices at the center O1 of triangle ABC, such that O1 lies on side DE and the radius of triangle DEC equals the circumradius of triangle ABC. A third equilateral triangle, FGH (centered at O3), is obtained by translating triangle DEC horizontally to the right without rotation or scaling. All vertices and centers are labeled as shown in the diagram.\n\nWhat is the length of segment AB?"
