    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle with side length 6 and center O1 is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger triangle. Let L2 and L3 denote two corresponding sides of the inner and outer triangles, respectively. Let M1 be the midpoint of L2 and M0 be the midpoint of L3. Segment M0M1 is drawn connecting these two midpoints.\n\nWhat is the measurement of Line M0M1?"
