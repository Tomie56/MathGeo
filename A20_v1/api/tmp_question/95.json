    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon is inscribed within another regular pentagon, both sharing the same center O1. The outer pentagon has vertices labeled A, B, C, D, E in counterclockwise order, and the inner pentagon has vertices labeled F, G, H, I, J, also in counterclockwise order. Point M0 lies on segment IJ and is the midpoint of segment L8 (assumed to be segment IJ based on context). A line is drawn from vertex G to point M0. Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by line segments AB and EA at vertex A."
