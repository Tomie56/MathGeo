    "In the given figure, a regular triangle with side length 9 is centered at O1. A circle is circumscribed about this triangle, and a second circle, centered at O2, is obtained by translating the first circle to the right. Points A, B, and C lie on the circles, with A and C being intersection points of the two circles, and B being a vertex of the original triangle. Line L2 is the line segment joining the centers O1 and O2. A perpendicular is drawn from point B to line L2, meeting it at foot F0, which lies on segment O1O2. Determine the length of segment BF0."
