    "In the given diagram, a regular pentagon ABCDE with center O1 and side length 4 is inscribed within another regular pentagon FGHIJ, also centered at O1. All vertices lie on concentric circles, and the inner pentagon is rotated such that its vertices lie on the sides of the outer pentagon. Consider the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AE. What is the radian measure of ∠BAE?"
