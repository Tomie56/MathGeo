    "Two circles intersect at points A and C. The left circle, centered at O₁, passes through vertices A, B, and C of an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 9. The right circle, centered at O₂, is a translation of the left circle to the right and also passes through A and C. Point B lies on the left circle only. The arc BC (denoted Arc_B_C) is the minor arc along the circumference of the left circle connecting points B and C.\n\nFind the length of Arc_B_C."
