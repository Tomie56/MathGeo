    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 6 is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2, resulting in a larger triangle DEF circumscribing the original triangle ABC. Point A is a vertex of the inner triangle, and a perpendicular is drawn from A to side BC (or its extension), meeting it at foot F0. Given this configuration, what is the measure of angle BAC in radians?"
