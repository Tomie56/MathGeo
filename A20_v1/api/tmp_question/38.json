    "In the given geometric construction, a larger equilateral triangle DEF is concentric with and twice the scale of a smaller equilateral triangle ABC, both centered at point O1. Points M0 and M1 are the midpoints of segments BC and AD, respectively. A new line segment M0M1 is drawn connecting these two midpoints. Given that the side length of the inner triangle ABC is 6, what is the length of segment M0M1?"
