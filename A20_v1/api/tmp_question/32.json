    "Two circles, centered at O₁ and O₂ respectively, intersect at points A and C. A third point B lies on the circumference of the circle centered at O₁ such that triangle ABC is inscribed in circle O₁. The side length of the equilateral triangle inscribed in circle O₁ is 9, and the circle has been translated to the right to produce circle O₂. Given that the arc length of circle O₁ (as derived from the geometric construction) is 12, what is the circumference of circle O₁?"
