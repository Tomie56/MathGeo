    "Two circles intersect at points A and C. Circle 1, centered at O1, passes through points A, B, and C, forming triangle ABC inscribed in it. Circle 2, centered at O2, is a translation of Circle 1 to the right and also passes through A and C. Triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 9, and the entire figure is rotated by π/3 radians about O1. Given this configuration, what is the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle between segments AB and AC at vertex A?"
