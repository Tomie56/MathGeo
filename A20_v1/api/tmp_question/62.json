    "Two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, are positioned such that square EFGH is translated perpendicularly from square ABCD along the direction of side CD, sharing vertex H with vertex C. Each square has side length 7. Point G is a vertex of the translated square EFGH, and point D is a vertex of the original square ABCD. A perpendicular is drawn from point G to line L3 — defined as the line containing segment CD — with foot at point D, which lies on segment CD.\n\nFind the length of segment GD."
