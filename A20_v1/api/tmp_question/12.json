    "In the given diagram, triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle centered at O1, with AB, BC, and CA as chords. A perpendicular is drawn from vertex A to chord BC, meeting it at point F0. Given that triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 7 and centered at O1, and that F0 lies on segment BC, determine the radian measure of angle BAC — the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AC."
