    "In the given geometric configuration, a regular triangle centered at point O1 with side length 6 is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2, resulting in a larger triangle DEF enclosing a smaller triangle ABC, both sharing the same center O1. Points A, B, and C lie on the inner triangle, and points D, E, and F lie on the outer triangle, with corresponding vertices aligned radially from O1. Line AB and Line CA intersect at vertex A. Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by Line AB and Line CA at point A."
