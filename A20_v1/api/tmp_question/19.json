    "Two circles, centered at O₁ and O₂ respectively, intersect at points A and C. A third point B lies on the circumference of the circle centered at O₁ such that triangle ABC is inscribed in this circle. The side length of the original regular triangle (centered at O₁) from which the circle was circumscribed is 9, and the circle has been translated rightward to produce the second circle centered at O₂. Given that the arc length of Circle_O₁ (as derived) is 12, what is the length of Circle_O₁?"
