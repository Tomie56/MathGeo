    "In the given geometric figure, a regular triangle with side length 6 and center O1 is concentrically scaled by a factor of 2 to form a larger triangle. Points M0 and M1 are the midpoints of segments L3 and L2, respectively, where L3 and L2 are corresponding sides of the inner and outer triangles. A line segment M0M1 is drawn connecting these midpoints. Determine the length of segment M0M1."
