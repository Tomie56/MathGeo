    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 6 is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2, resulting in an outer triangle DEF and an inner triangle ABC, both sharing center O1. Point M0 is the midpoint of segment DE, and point M1 is the midpoint of segment AC. Segment M0M1 is drawn, intersecting AB at point I3. Given this configuration, find the radian measure of angle BAC — that is, the angle formed at vertex A between segments AB and AC."
