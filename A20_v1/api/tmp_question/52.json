    "Two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, are positioned such that square EFGH is translated perpendicularly from square ABCD along the direction of side CD (or equivalently, side GH), sharing vertex H with vertex C. The centers of the squares are labeled O1 and O2, respectively. All sides are of length 7. Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by line segments AB and DA at vertex A."
