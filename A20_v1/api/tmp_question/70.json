    "In the given geometric configuration, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 4 undergoes a two-round derivation process: first, a vertex-on-center construction yields a second triangle centered at O2, and second, a translation produces a third triangle centered at O3. All constructions preserve the original side length. Point C lies on segment BE, and point O1 is the center of the initial triangle ABC. Line segment C–O1 is explicitly drawn connecting these two points.\n\nWhat is the length of segment C–O1?"
