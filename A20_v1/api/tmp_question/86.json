    "In the given diagram, a regular octagon with center O1 and side length 3 is shown, with vertices labeled A through H in counterclockwise order. Point F lies on side FG of the octagon. From point F, a perpendicular is dropped to the line extending side DE, meeting it at foot point F0. Calculate the length of segment EF0."
