    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at point O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation. A second derivation places a regular triangle centered at O2, with side length equal to that of the original pentagon, such that one of its vertices lies at O1. Point D is a vertex of this triangle lying on a segment of the inner pentagon. Line segment O1D connects the center of the pentagons to point D.\n\nFind the length of segment O1D."
