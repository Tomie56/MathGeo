    "In the given figure, two circles intersect at points A and C. The left circle is centered at O1 and passes through the vertices of an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 9. The right circle, centered at O2, is a translation of the left circle to the right. Points A, B, and C lie on the circumference of the left circle, with AB and BC being sides of the equilateral triangle. Determine the length of segment AB."
