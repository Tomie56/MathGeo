    "In the given diagram, two congruent squares share a common vertex H. Square ABCD is centered at O1, and square EFGH is centered at O2. Both squares have side length 7. A perpendicular is drawn from point G to line L3 (defined as line segment CD), with foot of the perpendicular at point D. What is the length of segment GD?"
