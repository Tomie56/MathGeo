    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation. A further derivation places a triangle centered at O2, with side length equal to that of the base pentagon, such that one of its vertices lies at O1. After connecting points C and A (both lying on existing segments), a total of 14 labeled points and 13 line segments are formed.  \n\nFind the radian measure of angle ∠K-O1-L, formed by the segments O1K and O1L meeting at vertex O1."
