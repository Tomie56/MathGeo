    "Two circles intersect at points A and C. The left circle, centered at O₁, circumscribes an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 9. The right circle, centered at O₂, is a translation of the left circle to the right. Segment AC is common to both circles and is vertical. Point B lies on the left circle and forms triangle ABC. What is the measure of angle BAC in radians?"
