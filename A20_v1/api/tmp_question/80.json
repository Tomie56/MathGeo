    "In the given geometric configuration, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 4 undergoes two rounds of derivation: first, a vertex-on-center construction yields a second triangle centered at O2 with radius equal to that of the original; second, a translation produces a third triangle centered at O3. The final figure contains 11 labeled points and 9 line segments. Among these, segment AO1 connects vertex A of the original triangle to its center O1.\n\nFind the length of segment AO1."
