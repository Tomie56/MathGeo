Circumscribed circle (center O1) around 3-sided polygon. Round 2: applying 'translation' rule. Translation derivation: circle (new center O2) translated right. Found 6 total points (including intersections). Geometry finalized: 0 new lines and 8 new arcs generated by splitting.

    "Two circles intersect at points A and C. The left circle is centered at O₁ and passes through vertices A, B, and C of an equilateral triangle ABC with side length 9. The right circle is centered at O₂ and is a translation of the left circle to the right, also passing through A and C. The arc BC lies on the left circle (center O₁). Find the length of arc BC."
