    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation. A second derivation places a triangle centered at O2, with side length equal to that of the base pentagon, such that one of its vertices lies at O1. Point K is a vertex of the inner pentagon, and point L is a vertex of the outer pentagon. Line segments O1K and LO1 are drawn. Determine the radian measure of the angle ∠KO1L formed at vertex O1 by the lines O1K and LO1."
