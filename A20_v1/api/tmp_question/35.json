    "In the given geometric figure, triangle ABC is inscribed within a larger triangle DEF such that both share the same center O1 and are concentric. Triangle ABC is a regular triangle with side length 6, and triangle DEF is a scaled version of ABC by a factor of 2. Point A is a vertex common to both triangles, and segments AB and AC are sides of the inner triangle ABC. Determine the radian measure of the angle formed by line AB and line CA at vertex A."
