    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 4 undergoes two derivation rounds: first, a vertex-on-center derivation producing a second triangle centered at O2 with radius equal to that of the base triangle; second, a translation producing a third triangle centered at O3. The figure contains 11 labeled points and 9 line segments. Point A lies on a segment common to the first and second triangles, and point O1 is the center of the original triangle. Line segment AO1 is explicitly drawn connecting these two points.\n\nCalculate the length of segment AO1."
