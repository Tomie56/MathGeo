    "In the given diagram, triangle ABC is inscribed in a circle centered at O1, with AB, BC, and CA as chords. Point F0 lies on segment BC such that AF0 is perpendicular to BC. Given that triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 7 and centered at O1, and that AF0 is the altitude from A to BC, what is the measure of angle BAC in radians?"
