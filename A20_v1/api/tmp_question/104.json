    "In the given geometric construction, starting with a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8, a second inscribed pentagon is formed via circum-inscription (Round 1), followed by a vertex-on-center derivation yielding a triangle centered at O2 (Round 2). After drawing a perpendicular from point I to line L5 (intersecting at foot F0), consider the angle formed at point O1 between segments O1K and O1L. Express this angle ∠KO1L in radians."
