    "Two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, are positioned such that square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD perpendicularly to side CD, with point H coinciding with point C. The side length of each square is 7 units. Let O₁ and O₂ denote the centers of squares ABCD and EFGH, respectively. Given this configuration, what is the measure of angle BAD in radians?"
