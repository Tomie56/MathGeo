    "In the given diagram, two congruent squares share a common vertex at point B. Square ABCD is centered at O1, and square BEFG is centered at O2, with square BEFG translated perpendicularly from side CD of square ABCD. Point H lies at the intersection of segments BC and EG. The line segment BD is drawn, connecting vertices B and D. Express the measure of angle BAD — formed by segments AB and AD — as a radian expression."
