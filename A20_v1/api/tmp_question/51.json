    "Consider two congruent squares sharing a common vertex H. The first square is ABCD with center O1, and the second square is EFGH with center O2. Square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD perpendicular to side DA such that point H coincides with point C of the original square. All sides have length 7. \n\nExpress the angle at point A between line segments AB and DA as a radian expression."
