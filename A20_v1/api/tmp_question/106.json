    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 undergoes two derivation rounds: first, an inscribed regular pentagon is drawn (also centered at O1); second, a triangle centered at O2 is derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1 and its side length equals that of the base pentagon. The final figure contains 14 labeled points and 13 line segments, with no arcs. In the first derivation step, a perpendicular is dropped from point I to line L5, meeting it at foot point F0.\n\nGiven this configuration, what is the radian measure of the angle ∠K-O1-L formed by segments O1K and O1L at vertex O1?"
