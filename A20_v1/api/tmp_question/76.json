    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 4 undergoes two rounds of derivation: first, a vertex-on-center derivation yielding a second triangle centered at O2, and second, a rightward translation yielding a third triangle centered at O3. The final figure comprises 11 labeled points and 9 line segments. In the final step of construction, vertex A is connected to M0, the midpoint of segment GF (denoted as L6). \n\nWhat is the length of segment AM0?"
