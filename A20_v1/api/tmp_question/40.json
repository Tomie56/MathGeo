    "In the given geometric figure, a regular triangle with side length 6 and center O1 is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2 to form a larger triangle. Let M0 be the midpoint of side BC and M1 be the midpoint of side DE. Segment M0M1 is drawn connecting these two midpoints. Determine the length of segment M0M1."
