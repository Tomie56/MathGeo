    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon with center O1 and side length 4 is inscribed within another regular pentagon of the same center, forming a concentric dual-pentagon structure. Points A, B, E lie on the outer pentagon, with segment BE drawn as a diagonal connecting two non-adjacent vertices. At vertex A, lines AB and AE are adjacent sides of the outer pentagon. What is the radian value of the angle between line AB and line EA at vertex A?"
