    "In the given diagram, two congruent squares share a common vertex at point B. The first square, ABCD, is centered at O1 and has side length 7. The second square, BEFG, is centered at O2 and is obtained by translating the first square perpendicularly to side CD (or equivalently, side AB extended). Point H lies at the intersection of segments BC and EF. A diagonal BD is drawn in square ABCD. \n\nWhat is the radian value of the angle between line AB and line DA at vertex A?"
