    "In the given geometric construction, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 4 is the base figure. A second triangle centered at O2 is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1, with radius equal to that of the base triangle. A third triangle, centered at O3, is obtained by translating the second triangle to the right. The figure includes labeled points A through H and centers O1, O2, O3. Given this construction, what is the length of segment GH?"
