    "In the given geometric construction, two circles intersect at points A and C, with centers O1 and O2 respectively. Point B lies on the circumference of the circle centered at O1, forming triangle ABC. A perpendicular is drawn from point B to the line segment AC, meeting it at foot point F0. Given that triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 9 and was constructed by circumscribing a circle around a regular 3-sided polygon centered at O1, then translating the circle to center O2, determine the radian measure of ∠BAC — the angle between segments AB and AC at vertex A."
