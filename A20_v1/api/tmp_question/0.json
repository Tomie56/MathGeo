    "Two circles intersect, with centers labeled O1 and O2. The upper circle is centered at O1 and the lower circle at O2. The circles intersect at two points labeled A and B. Point B lies on the arc of the upper circle (centered at O1) between the two intersection points. Given that the radius of each circle is 8 units, and assuming the line segment O1O2 is vertical and the distance between O1 and O2 is equal to the radius (8 units), what is the measurement of arc O1B — that is, the arc from point O1’s perspective along the upper circle from the topmost point of the circle to point B?\n\n(Note: The arc O1B refers to the arc on the upper circle starting from the point directly above O1 and ending at point B, traversing clockwise or counterclockwise along the circle’s circumference, depending on the diagram’s orientation. Since the diagram shows point B as the left intersection point, and assuming standard positioning, arc O1B is the minor arc from the top of circle O1 to point B.)\n\nWhat is the measurement of Arc_O1_B?"
