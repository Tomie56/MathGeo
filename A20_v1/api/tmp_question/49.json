    "Two congruent squares, ABCD and EFGH, are positioned such that square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD perpendicularly to side CD. The center of square ABCD is O1, and the center of square EFGH is O2. The side length of each square is 7 units. Point E lies on side BC of square ABCD, and point H lies on side CD. Given this configuration, find the length of segment EF."
