    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation. A subsequent vertex-on-center derivation produces a triangle centered at O2, with side length equal to that of the base pentagon. The diagram includes 14 labeled points (A–L, O1, O2) and 13 line segments, with no arcs or newly generated lines after finalization. Consider the angle ∠K-O1-L formed by segments O1K and O1L meeting at vertex O1.\n\nWhat is the measure of angle K-O1-L in radians?"
