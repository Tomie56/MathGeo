    "In the given geometric construction, a regular octagon centered at O1 with side length 10 is inscribed in a circle centered at O1. A second triangle (3-gon) centered at O2 is derived such that one of its vertices lies at O1, and its side length equals that of the octagon. The points I and J are vertices of this triangle, with O1 serving as one vertex. Considering the angle ∠IO1J formed by segments O1I and JO1, express this angle in radians."
