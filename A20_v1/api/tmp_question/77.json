    "In the given geometric configuration, a regular triangle with center O1 and side length 4 is the base shape. Through a vertex-on-center derivation, a second triangle centered at O2 is formed, sharing vertex A with the first triangle. A third triangle, centered at O3, is obtained by translating the second triangle to the right. Points A, O1, O2, and O3 are explicitly marked, and segment AO1 is drawn connecting vertex A to the center O1 of the base triangle.\n\nGiven that the side length of the base regular triangle (centered at O1) is 4, find the length of segment AO1."
