    "In the given geometric construction, a regular pentagon centered at O1 with side length 8 is inscribed within another regular pentagon (also centered at O1) via a circum-inscribe operation. A second derivation places a triangle centered at O2 such that one of its vertices coincides with O1, and its side length equals that of the original pentagon. Point K lies on the outer pentagon, point L lies on the inner pentagon, and both are connected to O1. Given the configuration and the derived relationships among points K, O1, and L, what is the measure of angle ∠K-O1-L in radians?"
