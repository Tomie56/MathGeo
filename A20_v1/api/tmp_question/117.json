    "In the given diagram, a regular octagon with side length 10 is inscribed in a circle centered at O1. A second equilateral triangle, centered at O2 and with side length equal to that of the octagon, is positioned such that one of its vertices lies at the center O1. Points A and C are vertices of the octagon lying on the circumcircle. Line segment CA connects these two vertices. Calculate the length of segment CA."
