    "In the given geometric figure, triangle ABC (centered at O1) is an equilateral triangle with side length 4. A second equilateral triangle, DEC (centered at O2), is constructed such that vertex A coincides with the center O2, and side DE is aligned vertically. A third equilateral triangle, FGH (centered at O3), is obtained by translating triangle ABC horizontally to the right. All triangles share the same side length. Given this configuration, what is the measurement of line segment DE?"
