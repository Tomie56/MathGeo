    "In the given diagram, a regular pentagon with center O1 and side length 4 is inscribed within another regular pentagon of the same center, forming a concentric structure. Points A, B, C, D, E are the vertices of the outer pentagon in clockwise order, and points F, G, H, I, J lie on the inner pentagon, with F on segment AB, G on BC, H on CD, I on DE, and J on EA. Segment BE is drawn, intersecting the inner pentagon at points I1 and I2. What is the radian value of the angle between line AB and line EA at vertex A?"
