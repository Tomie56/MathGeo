    "In the given geometric figure, a larger equilateral triangle DEF is concentric with a smaller equilateral triangle ABC, both centered at point O1. Triangle ABC has side length 6 and is rotated by π/3 radians relative to triangle DEF. Point M0 is the midpoint of side BC (line L1), and point M1 is the midpoint of side DE (line L3). A line segment M0M1 is drawn connecting these two midpoints. Given that the length of segment M0M1 is 8, verify or derive this length based on the geometric configuration.\n\nCalculate the length of line segment M0M1."
