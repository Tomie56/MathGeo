    "In the given geometric figure, a regular triangle centered at O1 with side length 6 is scaled concentrically by a factor of 2, resulting in an outer triangle DEF and an inner triangle ABC, both sharing vertex A and center O1. Point F0 lies on segment BC such that AF0 is perpendicular to BC. What is the radian value of the angle between line AB and line CA at vertex A?"
