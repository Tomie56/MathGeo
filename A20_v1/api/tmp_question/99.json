    "In the given diagram, a regular pentagon ABCDE with center O1 and side length 4 is inscribed within another regular pentagon FGHJI, also centered at O1. Point F0 lies on the extension of side GH such that HF0 is perpendicular to GH. Considering the outer pentagon ABCDE, what is the radian measure of the interior angle ∠BAE formed by segments AB and AE at vertex A?"
