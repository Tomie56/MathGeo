    "In the given diagram, two circles intersect at points A and C. Circle centered at O1 passes through vertices A, B, and C of an equilateral triangle with side length 9. Circle centered at O2 is a translation of the first circle to the right, sharing chord AC. Lines AB and AC are drawn. Express the angle ∠BAC — formed at point A between segments AB and AC — as a radian expression."
