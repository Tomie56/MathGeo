    "In the given diagram, two congruent squares are shown: square ABCD centered at O₁ and square EFGH centered at O₂. Square EFGH is obtained by translating square ABCD perpendicularly to side CD. Points B and D are vertices of square ABCD, and segment BD is drawn connecting them. Given that each side of the square measures 7 units, what is the length of segment BD?"
