    "In the given geometric figure, a regular triangle with center O1 and side length 4 is the base shape. Through a sequence of derivations — first placing a new triangle centered at O2 with vertices on the original triangle’s center, then translating a third triangle to center O3 — a composite figure is formed with 11 labeled points and 9 line segments. Among these, segment C–O1 is explicitly constructed by connecting point C (located on segment BE) to point O1 (the center of the original triangle). \n\nDetermine the length of segment C–O1."
