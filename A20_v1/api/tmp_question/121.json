    "In the given figure, a regular octagon with side length 10 is inscribed in a circle centered at O1. A second equilateral triangle, centered at O2, is constructed such that one of its vertices lies at O1 and its side length equals that of the octagon. Point H is a vertex of the octagon lying on the circle. Determine the length of segment O1H."
