    "In the given diagram, two congruent rhombi share a common vertex at point B. The first rhombus, centered at O₁, has vertices A, B, D, and C, with side length 7. The second rhombus, centered at O₂, is obtained by translating the first rhombus perpendicularly to side BD, and has vertices B, E, F, and H. Points B and D lie on the shared side of the two rhombi, and segment BD is drawn connecting them. Given that the side length of each rhombus is 7, what is the length of segment BD?"
