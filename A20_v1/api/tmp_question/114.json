    "In the given diagram, a regular octagon with side length 10 is inscribed in a circle centered at O1. A triangle IJ O2 is constructed such that O2 is its center and its side length equals that of the octagon. Points I and J lie on the circle centered at O1, and segments O1I and O1J are drawn. Determine the radian measure of the angle ∠IO1J formed at O1 by the lines O1I and O1J."
