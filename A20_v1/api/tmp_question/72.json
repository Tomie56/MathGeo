    "In the given geometric configuration, a regular triangle with center O1 and side length 4 is the base shape. A second triangle centered at O2 is derived by placing one of its vertices at O1, and a third triangle centered at O3 is obtained by translating the second triangle to the right. Point C lies on segment BE, and point O1 is the center of the base triangle. Line segment CO1 is drawn connecting these two points.\n\nWhat is the measurement of line segment CO1?"
