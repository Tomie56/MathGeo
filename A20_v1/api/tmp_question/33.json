    "In the given diagram, a larger triangle DEF is formed by scaling a smaller triangle ABC concentrically about point O1 by a factor of 2. Triangle ABC is equilateral with side length 6 and is oriented such that point A lies above segment BC. The scaled triangle DEF shares the same center O1 and orientation, with points D, E, and F corresponding to A, B, and C respectively. Segment FD is vertical and aligned with segment AC. What is the measurement of line segment FD?"
